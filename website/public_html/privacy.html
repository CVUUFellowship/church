    <div class='innerText'>This privacy policy has been compiled to better 
	    serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable 
	    information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US 
	    privacy law and information security, is information that can be 
	    used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or 
	    locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. 
	    Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear 
	    understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle 
	    your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our 
	    website.<br/></div>
    <span id='infoCo'></span><br><div class='grayText'><strong>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?</strong></div><br /><div class='innerText'>
	    In our publically accessible pages, we do not collect personal information from visitors, with the following exceptions:<br/><ul>
	    <li>we ask for a Name and Email address in our contact form, to respond to queries and comments</li>
	    <li>we log IP addresses with timestamps, to scan for attacks</li>
	    </ul><br/>
	    In our member pages, we maintain a directory of PII for members and friends including name, email, address, and phone number. Member accounts are available only to members and friends of the Fellowship, and can't be created by online visitors.
    </div><br>
    <div class='grayText'><strong>When do we collect information?</strong></div><br />
    <div class='innerText'>We collect information from visitors when you fill out a form  or enter information on our site or a third party service we are using. For example, we may use some Google Forms to enable sign ups for a Fellowship activity, and we also may receive some information from third parties when you fill out a survey or make a donation or purchase.</div><br>
    <div class='innerText'>We collect additional information from members and friends offline when you apply for membership or request an account, and when you update your information inside the member pages on our site.</div><br>
    <span id='infoUs'></span><br><div class='grayText'><strong>How do we use your information? </strong></div><br /><div class='innerText'>
	    We may use the information we collect from visitors to the website in the following ways:<br><ul>
		    <li><div class='innerText'>To respond to questions and comments from the contact form.</div></li>
		    <li><div class='innerText'>To analyze responses from surveys.</div></li>
		    <li><div class='innerText'>To keep you informed about the activity status if you have signed up for an activity.</div></li>
		    <li><div class='innerText'>To to follow up appropriately for a purchase or donation (with thanks, receipt, delivery details if necessary, etc).</div></li>
	    </ul>
	    <br/>
	    Members who provide their contact information and consent will be included in the members-only directory, and their contact information will be available to those who can access the members-only portion of the site for personal use in accordance with Fellowship policies (particularly including the Covenant of Good Relations). Those who can access this information must not use it for any commercial purposes, must avoid exposing the contact information to any third parties without prior consent, and must not add the contact information to any mailing lists without prior consent. Any violations of this policy by CVUUF participants will go through our conflict resolution process and may result in sanctions, up to and including legal action. Any others who access this private information and use it in a manner that violates this policy or otherwise causes inconvenience to our members may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law (but those who first demonstrate vulnerabilities to us without abusing any information discovered will instead be gratefully thanked). Members are not required to provide contact information or to consent to its presence online in order to be members in good standing.

For instance, we use cookies to help us remember whether a member is logged in.

    <div class='blueText'><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong></div><br /><div class='innerText'>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. -  See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br></div>

    <div class='blueText'><strong>How does CVUUF protect the personal information of children?</strong></div><br /><div class='innerText'>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.  The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br><br></div><div class='innerText'>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</div><span id='ftcFip'></span><br>
    <div class='blueText'><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></div><br /><div class='innerText'>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br><br>
</div><div class='innerText'><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></div><div class='innerText'>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days</div><div class='innerText'>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days</div><div class='innerText'><br>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</div><span id='ourCon'></span><br>
