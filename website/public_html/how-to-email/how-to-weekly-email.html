	<div class="intro">
		<p>This is a step-by-step guide with screenshots and explanations for how to make and send the weekly email from mailchimp for the congregation, written in December of 2014.</p>
		<p>The hope is that anyone who isn't just scared of computers can do this job if they're willing and able to spend about 2 hours on a computer making a document they can be proud of for the benefit of the Fellowship. If you accept this mission you'll deserve the thanks of a grateful communications director, and maybe even get it.</p>
		<p>It's possible this page is out of date or incomplete or has an error, so don't think it's your fault if you run into trouble trying to get it to work right. Like most things with computers, it's usually possible to make it work if you persevere, but it's sometimes harder than it seems like it should be. If you run into trouble or you've got any questions, even if it's just making you feel stupid in that special way that only computers can do, don't give up. If your first 10 minutes with google hasn't solved your problem, talk to me (Jake Holland) or send email to <a href="mailto:communicationsdirector@cvuuf.org">communicationsdirector@cvuuf.org</a>. If you're willing to spend some time on this, I'll do what I can to make it so the Fellowship gets some benefit out of your hard work.</p>

	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>1. Access</h2>
		<p>Before you can actually do the steps below, you'll need to have access to the mailchimp account. If you decide you want to give it a shot, send me email saying so and I'll give you "Author" access to the account. Once that happens, mailchimp will send you some login instructions, and after that you should be able to follow these steps and put together the email and send a test email to a few individuals for proofreading. After you've done it a few times and you're used to the system, I'll probably set you up so you can send it out to everybody. The rest of these instructions will assume you've got that access, and they start right after you've logged in. If you got that far, it will probably look something like this:</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="logged_in.png" alt="First page after login" />
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>2. Getting to the Right Page</h2>
		<p>Once you're at the dashboard, you need to get to get to the "Campaigns" ("Campaign" is what Mailchimp calls an email that goes out to a list of addresses). Depending on your screen size, you may or may not already have a menu visible on the left side of your screen. If you don't, you can get one by clicking the 3 bars in the top left.</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="step1_nav.png" alt="Click top left for menu" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Select "Campaigns".</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="step2_nav.png" alt="Campaigns is what you want" />
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>3. Start by Replicating</h2>
		<p>Once you're looking at the Campaigns list, the latest News and Notes email will probably be near the top. The simplest approach is to replicate that email, and then edit it for this week.</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="replicate_latest.png" alt="Replicate the latest News and Notes" />
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>4. Check the Recipients List</h2>
		<p>
		Once you click Replicate, you'll be in the "Recipients" stage for the email, which starts with choosing the list of recipients.</p>
		<p>It's very important to make sure that the Recipients are the people signed up for Weekly announcements. There's people who don't want to receive the weekly emails but still want to receive important special announcements or the monthly newsletters, and we have to be careful to respect their wishes. For the weekly emails, the list is called "Weekly Announcements", and you only see it if the "Saved Segments" button is pressed.
		</p>
		<p>After you've checked that, click on the bottom right to move to the next stage, "Setup".</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="recipients.png" alt="Check the list segment" />
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>5. Setup</h2>
		<p>Probably you only need to change the titles. The top one is the one that appears in the mailchimp list of campaigns, and the bottom one is the subject for the email. Usually, just changing the date is sufficient. After replicating, this title will also have a "(copy 1)" on the end of it, which you should remove, but it's not too important. But the dates are pretty useful to make right.</p>
		<p>There's other setup options on this page, like the reply email address. Unless you have a reason, you probably should just use the same as the week before, which is part of why it's such a good idea to start this by replicating.</p>
		<p>Again, after you've finished click on the bottom right button to advance to the next stage.</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="set_titles.png" alt="Fix the replicated titles, and other setup" />
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>6. Pick Template (might be skipped for you)</h2>
		<p>If you made a new email, you'll get a "Choose template" page, but if you replicated it will automatically skip over this step, so I didn't make a screenshot, but I thought I'd mention it's there if you made the email from scratch. I think our weekly email at the time of this writing is either 1-column or 1-column banded (which are mostly the same).</p>
		<p>There's a "simple text" template at the bottom that I use for the special announcements without pictures, and knock yourself out if you want to get fancy with the number of columns or having a sidebar, but otherwise you probably don't have to do anything for this step. I'm not sure what the process is for keeping your work if you decide to switch templates in the middle, so you might want to experiment separately if you're considering it.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>7. Craft the email.</h2>
		<p>Ideally, you'll spend about 75% of your time here and about 25% of your time on proofreading/responding to review/touching-up, and hopefully a negligible amount on "other" (logging in, clicking around looking for things, getting stuck with mailchimp, etc.).</p>
		<p>The email's purpose is to let people know about all the things Fellowship members might want to know this week, well enough that they know what to do if they're interested in more. For many things that means showing a date, time, and location, and for most things it means saying who to contact for more questions.</p>
		<p>It might be more than just what's happening this week, because things that are coming up in the next few months can be useful to put in your calendar, but you don't want to repeat the same stuff for the far future too often every week. Unless there's a reason otherwise, my rule of thumb for most one-off events is to shoot for 1-3 notifications total across different weeks, including (hopefully always) an entry the week it's actually happening, and you want maybe about 8-12 items highlighted in the email each week, and it's easier when somebody sent in a blurb, so that's usually what gets picked. But both numbers are flexible, and anything that members might want to participate in or know about is a fine thing to include.</p>
		<p>You can always check the <a href="/webcal/month.php">calendar</a> and the <a href="/public/newsletter">newsletter</a> and look for things that are this week, plus if you're doing this regularly you're hopefully receiving email sent to NewsandNotes@cvuuf.org and announce@cvuuf.org, and if not you'll hopefully get a list forwarded from Jessica or me or another regular, plus you can look at older emails for things that appeared one time last month or so, and is coming up next month or so, but hasn't yet had a second reminder. There's also the <a href="/public/announcements">announcements</a> page, which we're considering replacing with the web version of this email, but we might keep a similar page just for keeping this list of things more organized.</p>
		<p>Once you've got the right set of things that should appear, there's 3 major things you're shooting for:</p><ul>
			<li><h4>Correct</h4>Remember that after it appears in this email, people might hop in their cars and drive somewhere at the appointed time. Please take the extra minute to double-check that the time and location is the same as what you were told. It's easy to accidentally type a 7 instead of a 6 without realizing it, and that could cost a bunch of interested people an hour or more and send them home disgruntled.</li>
			<li><h4>Useful</h4>This weekly email is a great way to get the word out, but it only works if people want to read it, and they'll only want to read it if it's pretty much useful every week. If it stops being useful, people will unsubscribe and it will stop being a great way to get the word out. This is why you don't want to repeat the same things too often, and you want a higher focus on the things coming up this week, and you want to list enough things that most people are interested in something, but not SO many things that nobody will want to scroll through them. It's a delicate balance and the ideal answer is not known.</li>
			<li><h4>Easy to Read</h4>When something is nice to look at and easy to read, people are more likely to go ahead and read it. If the font is too small or too weird, if the picture is too unrelated to the words, if the sentence structure doesn't make sense, it's easy for a reader to get distracted and give up. There's no easy advice for how to make things easy to read, but try to keep this goal near the forefront of your mind, and look for ways the writing or picture could be misinterpreted, so you can avoid them. I often take 3 or 4 tries at rewriting a paragraph, because it keeps getting easier to read or more clear. It's usually worthwhile if you can afford to do it.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>7.a. Image with caption</h3>
		<p>I use "Image with Caption" for most of the entries in the email. Usually the text comes from whomever sent a request for it to be in the email (sometimes with some minor edits), and sometimes they might also point you at a logo or picture to use, but often I just pick out the picture from a clip art library, or from searching online.</p>
		<p>When you search for images online, be a little careful about copyrights--just because it showed up on google image search doesn't mean you have the right to copy and send it. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/follow-this-chart-to-know-if-you-can-use-an-image-from-1615584870">There's</a> <a href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/copyright-fair-use-and-how-it-works-for-online-images/">lots</a> <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac-software/law-using-free-images-found-online-3526354/">of</a> <a href="http://www.techsoup.org/support/articles-and-how-tos/finding-and-using-images-from-the-web">great</a> <a href="http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4693-legal-image-usage.html">advice</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nonprofit+using+an+image+from+the+internet">online</a>. It's always safe if you make your own image, and most other things for our purposes fall under the "limited non-profit use" fair use clause. Be a little careful, don't do things like removing a copyright notice from a clip art, and remember some of these things are somebody's livelihood, and when it is they're more likely to be <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Disney%27s+penchant+for+lawsuits+called+%22grumpy+and+mean-spirited.%22...-a011514183">litigious</a>. Whereas I'll maybe not worry too much about promoting Community Forum or Camp DeBenneville with an image off their respective websites (even if I really probably ought to ask first), I'll probably avoid using a Mickey Mouse to promote the Disney trip, just out of paranoia.</p>
		<p>When in doubt, it's ok to put something in without a picture, and sometimes I do it just because I like to have some variety in the email structure, but I think pictures tend to be a nice addition to the email, and they help some people to take in the content and be able to find it again when they're looking for it in an old email or trying to remember what it was. If you end up accidentally using something that a rights-holder objects to, we might get a cease-and-desist letter from their lawyers, but we probably won't be fined for the first offense if it was an honest mistake. So don't be scared of trying, but do be a little bit aware and careful to respect the rights of others.</p>
		<p>Anyway, to add an image-with-caption block to the email, drag it in:</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="image_with_caption2.png" alt="Drag the block into the email" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Then paste in your text:</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="image_with_caption3.png" alt="Put in some text" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>And drag in your image from a local file on your machine:</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="drag_image_file2.png" alt="Drag in your image" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Click on the "settings" tab if you want to adjust the proportion of text and image, or which side the image is on. I usually like to alternate the side the image is on, but it's not required:</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="image_with_caption_settings.png" alt="Go to the settings tab" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>I usually prefer 3/4 or 2/3 (instead of the default 1/2) for how much space the caption gets, but if you're writing it it's up to you:</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="image_with_caption_settings2.png" alt="Set position and size" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>I usually do the settings first and the text formatting next, just because the text formatting might depend on how much space you've decided to use. I usually set a title to heading 2 or heading 3 in the "styles" button (just select the text, then pull the dropdown), and I'll sometimes use things like bold or italics or underline or font however I think it ends up looking best in the text. The toolbar has a set of tools that should look pretty familiar if you've ever used a word processing program. Just use your judgement as best you can and keep your 3 goals in mind: Correct, Useful, Easy to Read.</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="image_with_caption_settings3.png" alt="Back to content, and format the text" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>When you're satisfied, Save and Close will take you back to the main view.</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="image_with_caption_finish.png" alt="Finish up the block" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>I like to put a divider between the blocks. Helps with the "Easy to Read".</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="drag_divider.png" alt="Drag in a divider" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<h3>7.b. Things this week</h3>
		<p>Make sure you check carefully the "What's Happening This Week" section against the <a href="/webcal/month.php">calendar</a> from the cvuuf.org website. Remember "Correctness" on this. We usually put in the events from one Sunday service to the next Sunday Service.</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="things_this_week.png" alt="Things this week" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<h3>7.c. Tricks and tips</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<p>Some date formats are better than others. If gmail can recognize a string as a date, it will make a "add to calendar" link that people can just click. "Saturday, January 17 2015, 8:00pm" is one such format, and there may be others. You can experiment, and it's good to try to make sure it's readable, but also try to make it come out as a clickable date if you can:</p>
			<div class="screenshot">
				<div class="image">
					<img src="date_format.png" alt="Date format matters" />
				</div>
			</div>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>It's helpful for the readers if you organize the entries in the order of times you have to worry about it, all things being equal, though sometimes priority can matter more. Best guess is that readers are more likely to look at the earlier entries.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>It's nice to maintain the same image for the same entry if it appears in later weeks, and to NOT use the same image for different entries within the same couple of months.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>8. Review checklist</h2>
		<p>This checklist may change going forward, but I put it together for a quick list of things to check before sending.</p>
<ul>
<li>dates gmail-clickable</li>
<li>sanely ordered, mostly by date</li>
<li>check volunteer opportunities (with contacts)</li>
<li>contacts in all items (note any exceptions)</li>
<li>all calendared entries</li>
<ul><li>calendared dates</li></ul>
<li>list of facts checked</li>
<li>preparer/reviewer credits</li>
<li>reviewer send report</li>
</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>9. Send a test email</h2>
		<p>Once you're satisfied with the contents of the email, send a test email. I might make a mailing list it goes to, but for now just make sure it includes me and you and whoever you think would be a good person to review it before it goes to the ~300 people on the list (mostly all Fellowship members).</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="send_test1.png" alt="from the Preview and Test button" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Add any special requests or instructions for your reviewers.</p>
		<div class="screenshot">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="send_test2.png" alt="send the email" />
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>10. Send it to everybody</h2>
		<p>You probably can't do this step yet. When you're first starting out, you'll only have "author" access, so you'll be able to make a campaign just like what's described above, but you won't be able to send it to everybody.</p>
		<p>After you've done it a time or 2 and you're comfortable with it, I'll probably add you as a "manager", which lets you click the confirm button on the bottom and send it out to everybody. There's really not that much to it, I just wanted to have a cross-check or 2 to make sure nothing important got missed or miscommunicated. I could have used that my first few times.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="instruction">
		<h2>11. Coordination</h2>
		<p>There's a signup we can schedule with at <a href="/supporttest/em">/supporttest/em</a>.</p>
		<p>In practice, it seems we often forget to use that. This may have to change as we get more people, and the big worry is that maybe we'll miss a week or something by getting mixed up on who's doing what.</p>
		<p>Most of the time, in practice, Jessica puts together a first draft on Friday, and we send it out late Saturday night or early Sunday morning.</p><p>Regardless of who does the first draft, I do like for it to get a close review before it goes out, when possible. There are often errors, which is entirely expected, that's just the nature of emails. But when sending it out to 300 people, those errors will get noticed and sometimes remarked upon, and occasionally (especially if the schedule is wrong) might cause someone considerable inconvenience, so it pays to be careful.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="conclusion">
		<p>Thanks for reading this far, and thanks for helping out with this vital task for keeping the congregation informed. This is a weekly way to reach hundreds of people in the congregation and to help encourage their spiritual growth. Few of the things we do regularly have a broader embrace, and the Fellowship couldn't function without the help of people like you who are willing to help out with these things.</p>
