<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jews have just
marked the Days of Awe, the Day of Remembrance and Judgment and the Day of
Atonement. These are the days, the High Holy Days, which set them apart as the
people called Israel. Yom Kippur, ending at sunset yesterday, marks the end of
Judaism’s High Holy Days. One of the rituals included in this ancient tradition
is for the leader and the congregation to say together at the beginning of the
evening service three times “May all the people of Israel be forgiven,
including all the strangers who live in their midst, for all the people are in
fault.” This seems to be a story told about a people only, one tribe, but the
individual’s conduct over the past year affects the entire community. Who the
community is, how the community defines itself, is based on the behavior of the
individual. Even those who do not identify as part of the people, the tribe,
are held responsible for the spiritual health of the community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>On the Day of
Atonement Jews fast and pray all day. There is a public remission of vows, vows
thoughtlessly made in the previous year and reckless promises they may make in
the year to come. A prayer is sung, the formula recited: we transgress and are
forgiven. This public recitation of individual sins requires that the community
takes responsibility for what happens in it. There is an acknowledgment that
the community is of one body and all are responsible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“May all the
people of Israel be forgiven, including all the strangers who live in their
midst, for all the people are in fault.” “If even one of us remained silent
when a single voice would have made a difference” (Robert Eller-Isaacs), then
all of us are responsible. “May all the people of Israel be forgiven, including
all the strangers who live in their midst, for all the people are in fault.” If
one of us was paralyzed by fear when trust could have moved us forward, we are
all responsible. “May all the people of Israel be forgiven, including all the
strangers who live in their midst, for all the people are in fault.” If just one
of us struck out in damaging anger, we are all responsible. The individual asks
for forgiveness and the community that stands with them is made up of
individuals asking for forgiveness. What affects one of us, affects us all.
Asking for forgiveness, we take responsibility for ourselves and for the
community we co-create.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The holiest day of
the Jewish year Jews come before their God and hope for forgiveness. This is
part of their identity as Jews. Forgiveness is also part of the identity of
Christians. Christians, borrowing from their Jewish heritage, are also asked to
repent before they can expect forgiveness. Christians carry the idea of
forgiveness as central to their identity even further in what one scholar sees
as a misreading of Jesus’ teaching to “turn the other cheek.” Eva Fleischner
wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>I believe Christians – and
non-Christians in their wake – have misread, and continue to misread, these texts,
interpreting Jesus’ teaching to mean that we are to forgive anyone and
everyone, whatever the wrong done to anyone. The element that is lost sight of
is that Jesus challenges <i>me</i> to forgive evil done to <i>me</i> (in itself
quite enough of a challenge!). Nowhere does he tell us to forgive the wrong
done to another. Yet, the widespread impression persists among Christians that,
to be truly Christian, we must forgive, plain and simple, no matter who has
been sinned against. (Essay in <i>The Sunflower: On the Possibilities and
Limits of Forgiveness</i>, pp. 140-141)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We’ve all seen
them: those pitiable fellow humans standing in front of a camera on the evening
news just minutes after losing a loved one to unspeakable violence. They
proclaim from the depths of their despair that they are a Christian and because
of that they will forgive the perpetrator of the heinous crime. And we do not
believe them. We do not believe them because we think if we were the ones
standing in their place in that moment of shock and utter disbelief forgiveness
is not what we would offer. We could hardly offer anything to anyone, much less
forgiveness to the one responsible for our anguish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Five years ago this
month we watched the despair and anguish of the Amish community of Nickel Mines
in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. A gunman walked into a one-room schoolhouse,
opening fire on 10 little girls, killing five. The quiet landscape of Amish
country was invaded first by an act of violence and then the media came.
National and international media filled the quiet countryside, snapping
pictures of people who object on religious grounds to their photos being taken.
The morning of the girls' funerals, cameramen lined the streets as the horse
and buggy procession passed. We watched a community in shock, mourning their
loss. We watched a solemn community reach out to the family of the gunman, some
of them even attending his funeral. The community’s quick move to forgiveness
and reconciliation became the topic of the evening news as we all watched and
wondered how we would have responded if our child’s life had been so brutally
cut short.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There were no
interviews given proclaiming forgiveness as the correct response. No one stood
in front of a camera in shock and despair declaring that their identity as a people
demanded forgiveness. Although we did not hear pitiable, intrusive interviews,
we watched. We watched how they responded. We saw the familiar black and white
of their simple existence against the backdrop of a way of life they seemed
exempt from: the violence broadcast daily, victims lives insensitively exposed.
We saw forgiveness in the actions of the Amish community and we believed them.
The Amish did not offer a cheap, easy forgiveness to pardon a dead man for his
unpardonable act of violence. If he had lived, they would have expected the man
to be punished.  Because he did not live – he killed himself after killing five
of their own – they attended his funeral and gave his family some of the money
that had poured into their community after the tragedy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The Amish did not
offer cheap, easy forgiveness because they knew that forgiveness is a journey
that never ends. “When recently asked about what he had learned over the last
five years, one of the Amish fathers said, ‘I have learned that healing is possible.
And that it is not yet finished’” (L. Gregory Jones, “Living forgiveness:
Lessons on the fifth anniversary of the Amish schoolhouse shootings”). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This is a
community’s response, a rising up as one body to forgive what has damaged the whole
– an innate knowing that has been forged in the practice of being community.
The tribal response of a community set apart by their simple way of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Judith Toy did not
have a community of forgiveness to turn to when her family was murdered
(source: <a href="http://theforgivenessproject.com/stories/">http://theforgivenessproject.com/stories/</a>).
And she didn’t offer forgiveness immediately. She did not stand before the
cameras on the nightly news and offer forgiveness to the 19-year-old neighbor
who brutally murdered her sister-in-law and her two teenaged nephews. It wasn’t
until five years later, through her newfound practice of daily mindfulness in
the Zen Buddhist tradition, that Judith spontaneously forgave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>After the murders
Judith turned to meditation to help ease her grief and confusion. One day,
nearly five years after the murders, she sat down to write a poem. She was
reminded of these words by her teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I am the frog,
swimming happily</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> in the clear
waters of my pond,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> and I am the grass-snake
who,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> approaching in
silence,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> feeds itself on
the frog.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> I am the child in
Uganda, all skin and bones,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> my legs as thin
as bamboo sticks,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> and I am the arms
merchant, selling deadly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> weapons to
Uganda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As she wrote her
own words down, she knew the hard truth of her teacher’s poem. She knew the “I
am” of “the 12 year old girl, refugee on a small boat,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> who throws
herself into the ocean</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> after being raped
by a sea pirate,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> and [the] I am
[of] the pirate, my heart not yet capable</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> of seeing and loving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>That was the day I stopped thinking of
Charles as the beast and began thinking of him as a boy in whom something had
gone awfully wrong, [writes Judith]. The pain of resentment vanished! Breathing
out, I saw in me the seeds of murder, seeds which have <u>never</u> been
watered and so they have withered. Still they are there. I saw within me not
only the victims, but also the perpetrator. Sadly, before I was able to tell
him so, Charles took a laundry bag and hung himself in a prison cell. I mourned
his passing. Twelve years after the murders, his mother and I cried together
over our mutual loss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This solitary act
of forgiveness arises not from tribal, set apart community. This solitary,
spontaneous act of forgiveness arises out of the knowledge of our connection to
the whole of humanity. It is a knowledge that comes out of the willingness to
see the seeds of murder in our own hearts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Most of us will
not have to be confronted with the choice of forgiving a loved one’s murderer,
but we may be asked to forgive an act that causes us heartbreaking pain. We may
not be asked, but we may choose to forgive anyway. Many survivors of childhood
sexual abuse choose to forgive their perpetrators, knowing that this act of
forgiveness frees them and subsequent generations from the cycle of abuse.
Survivors of the suicide of a loved one may eventually decide to forgive the
one who has abruptly left them behind, knowing that their own healing resides
in a relationship that does not end with death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>These are all
large acts of forgiveness that we can return to again and again on ritual days
of atonement, on anniversaries and in the quiet of our own spiritual practices.
It is the smaller, everyday acts of forgiveness that remind us that the word
fault does not mean blame and that we are each responsible for the spiritual
health of the community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The story of the
prince and the rhinoceros is a folktale about forgiveness told at the level a
child can understand. The sort of forgiveness called for is the smaller,
everyday act of forgiveness needed after harsh words. The kind of forgiveness a
parent needs after yelling at a child too severely. The kind of forgiveness a
partner needs after lashing out in anger and frustration. The kind of
forgiveness a co-worker needs after criticizing another’s efforts. There is a
happy ending to the story of the prince and the rhinoceros. They lived forever
after — in friendship and great joy. Never again did an unkind word pass
between them because the prince asked for forgiveness and the rhinoceros granted
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I think there’s
something missing in this simple story. Maybe they really did live forever
after in friendship and great joy, but even after the rhinoceros forgave the
prince, the prince would have to forgive himself. Even after the child forgives
the parent, the parent will want to forgive themself. Even after the partner is
forgiven in love, in self-love they will forgive again. This is the truth that
the Amish now know five years later. They responded with forgiveness
immediately to the gunman and his family. This forgiveness sent them on a
journey where they discovered that healing is possible. The journey is not
over. What started with reaching out to others will end in a journey to the
self. What the Amish of Nickel Mines will discover, may have already discovered
is that all acts of forgiveness lead back to the self.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“May all the
people of Israel be forgiven, including all the strangers who live in their
midst, for all the people are in fault.” For even we have had times when we
have ignored the needs of others. “May all the people of Israel be forgiven,
including all the strangers who live in their midst, for all the people are in
fault.” Even we have broken our covenant and refused to see the worth of
another. “May all the people of Israel be forgiven, including all the strangers
who live in their midst, for all the people are in fault.” Yes, even we have
thought we were separate and superior. May we all be forgiven. May it be so.
Amen.</p>
