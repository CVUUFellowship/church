<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>I
have a niece whose family attends a Presbyterian Church near their home in
Northern California.  One of the activi­ties at the church that has engaged her
husband is the men’s group, led by the minister.  Apparently in one of their
meetings, they were discussing different religious traditions with the
minister, and Jeff said to him, “My wife’s aunt is a Unitarian minister; what
do <u>they</u> believe?”  The minister thought for a moment, and then, very
diplomatically, answered, “Well…they’re good folks; they share some of our
beliefs and values.  They’re a little loosey-goosey, but….”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Now, I’m not sure just what
he meant by that.  It could be that he was referring to some of our
organizational structure which, in the eyes of ministers in more hierarchical
traditions, <u>might</u> seem a bit “loosey-goosey!”  Apparently some man once
was asked if he belonged to any organized religion, and he responded, “Oh no;
I’m a Unitarian Universalist!” I am pleased to note that the leadership of this
congregation has done a lot over the last few years to make that joke
irrelevant!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Some of this perceived
“loosey-goosiness” may be manifested through our anti-authoritarianism, which
UUs have tended to raise to a high art form, especially on the West Coast. A
few weeks ago, I shared with you that the first congregation I served used to
love recalling how, when I came there as their first minister in their 25-year
history, they’d only allow me to preach once a month, so afraid were they that
this new preacher would come in and take over!  The decision to move me to
twice a month came only after a survey was taken to see whether people wanted
that or not. (They did.) By the time I left there fifteen years later, I was
responsible for the normal three services a month; but it was a slow process!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          And while they and I would
tell this story with affectionate chuckles, it does point to both a fear of
unbridled ministerial authority, and a celebration of what many Unitarian and
Universalist theologians have called “the Priesthood of all believers” – the
idea, going back to Martin Luther, that wisdom is spread among us all, and does
not rest with just the ordained clergy.  It also points to our commitment to
the democratic process – our 5<sup>th</sup> UU Principle.  The most important
decisions – including the choice of the minister – are usually made by the
members of a congregation, hopefully after ample opportunities for you to
educate yourselves on the issues, and to voice your opinions.  We have no
bishops who choose our leaders, or decide what stands to take on important
social issues; it’s all up to you, the laity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          But I suspect that the real
reason my niece’s minister called us “loosey-goosey” had to do with our
theology – with our <i>beliefs</i>, or lack thereof.  For that is where non-UUs
seem to have the most difficulty with us; they just can’t figure out what the
heck we believe!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Several years ago, after
officiating at a wedding ceremony, one of the guests approached me and asked
what religion I was representing.  When I told him Unitarian Universalism, he
said, “Uni-<u>what</u>?” with a quizzical look on his face.  “Unitarian
Universalism,” I sighed, bracing myself for the next question:  “What’s that?” 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>So I began my
standard explanation: “A religion which evolved out of the Christian tradition,
which believes there are many paths to religious understanding, blahdy, blahdy,
blah….” Finally, with some exasperation, the man said,       “Oh well, at least
we’re all Christians!” – to which I replied: “Well…not necessarily.”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>I explained
that UUs see Jesus as a great teacher and prophet, but not as God or the
Messiah. I said that we turn not only to the life and teachings of Jesus, but
to those of the Buddha, Mohammed, and many others.  Now <u>thoroughly</u>
confused, the man said, “Oh well…we all believe in the same God!”  “Well…” I
said, and changed the subject.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          It <u>is</u> hard to pin us
down theologically.  We don’t have a Creed like most other traditions; instead,
we have seven “Principles,” found in the front of our hymnbook, which evolved
from a long process carried on in UU congregations across the continent,
culminating in a vote by delegates to our General Assembly.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And these
Principles don’t tell us what to believe, but rather what it is we <u>value</u>
– what we “covenant to affirm and promote.”  They serve as a guide for how we
treat one another, how we treat the earth, and how we envision the world. But
they do not tell us anything about the existence or nature of God, about what
constitutes sin, or about what happens to us after we die.  <i>Those </i>hard
questions are left for us to struggle with, individually and as a religious
community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Someone once said that
Unitarian Universalism is a <u>questing</u> religion; that we are not a
“chosen” people, but a “choosing” people – hence the term “heretics” for us –
people who <u>choose</u> what we believe.  Ours is a <i>fluid</i> religion,
which honors ambiguity and movement, and affirms both science <u>and</u>
mystery.  And while this may make some people uncomfortable, I find it the most
endearing and profound aspect of our faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I once heard of a woman who
was about to go through some classes to join one of the Protestant churches,
but finally decided against it because she didn’t believe in the creeds. When
she informed the minister of her decision, he said, “My dear lady, we don’t ask
that you <u>believe</u> the creeds; only that you <u>memorize</u> them!”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>But as with
most of <u>us</u>, this woman couldn’t recite something she didn’t believe, as
if she did; she needed to be <u>authentic</u> in her religious practice.  She
understood what Thomas Paine asserted: “Infidelity doesn’t consist in believing
or disbelieving; it consists in <u>professing</u> to believe what one does <u>not</u>
believe.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          As Unitarian Universalists,
we are called to reject such “infidelity,” in every corner of our life – but
most particularly in the religious corner.  This is why there are jokes about
UUs praying “to Whom it may concern;” or that we are poor hymn-singers because we’re
always reading ahead to see if we agree with the words!  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>But these are
important distinctions.  Rather than signifying a lack of conviction, they
point to the fact that we cherish our ability to think, and experience, and
sort out, and interpret for ourselves.  As both Jesus <i>and</i> the Buddha
encouraged their followers, we are lamps unto ourselves, and we let those lamps
illuminate the world around us so that we can see more clearly, and help others
to see <u>themselves</u> more clearly.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>In his book, <u>Challenge
of a Liberal Faith</u>, George Marshall affirmed that “by joining a Unitarian
Universalist church, we recognize that there <u>are</u> no Holy books, but that
all ideas that are creative and inspiring and lead to a better life are
religious.  We recognize that all days are holy…all people sacred…and all life
a unity.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          But that does leave things
pretty wide open – even “loosey-goosey,” perhaps. And one of the concerns about
us has been whether we hold anything to be absolute; is there any “Absolute
Truth” for a UU?   Other religions <u>do</u> claim some absolutes: the
existence of a god or gods, the nature of evil, what constitutes sin, etc.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And in the
early Unitarian and Universalist church, there <i>were</i> some absolutes: the
Unitarians believed in one God versus the trinity; the Univer­salists believed
in salvation for all, even the most sinful. And both traditions stood firmly by
their belief in the absolute right of every person to read the Bible and
interpret it for him or herself – which of course opened up the possibility of
challenges to those other two absolutes. Every belief opened up new questions
and doubts.  It is no different for our faith today; as the sign in front of
Throop UU Church in Pasadena used to read: “Have all your answers questioned
here!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          The Rev. David Parke has
said that “The freedom to define one’s faith is sacred and, within the limits
of humans, absolute.”  Is such freedom “loosey-goosey?”  I don’t think so. 
Indeed, is it really so different from the Jewish tradition of arguing one
theological point, and then saying, “On the other hand….” We, like they, <i>love
</i>the argument; we cherish the dialogue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          There
is a story of a conversation overheard one day between two women, where one
asked the other what Unitarian Universalists believe.  Without a moment’s
hesitation, the second woman replied, “Recycling!”  Well, that’s pretty true; indeed,
it could have been a conversation here at CVUUF, given the work you’re doing on
Climate Change. This “belief” in recycling (and other earth-sustaining
practices) is grounded in our seventh Principle – “Respect for the interde­pendent
web of all existence of which we are a part.”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>But
if those two women were to read the Mission Statement of <i>this </i>congregation,
they would learn more about UU beliefs; they would see that you strive to be
“spiritually courageous,” so that you can “transform the world through justice
and compassion” – something desperately needed in these times.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>If
they were to read your website and newsletter, they’d learn that you are deeply
involved in the needs of the wider community – through your monthly Community Forums
that offer education and inspiration about important issues; through your
collection of food every Sunday for the Manna Food Bank, and your providing and
serving of food at Calvary Community Church to people in need; through
letter-writing to prison inmates in solitary confinement; and through your work
for marriage equality, immigrant rights, income inequality, and other issues of
justice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText2 style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And
if those two women wondering what UUs believe were to spend <i>time </i>with
you, they would witness a people who take the spiritual journey seriously; who
care <u>deeply</u> about one another’s personal “joys and sorrows;” who are
committed to children – your own, and those in the wider community; and who know
that our Unitarian Universalist values cannot remain within these walls, but
must be incarnated as we work for justice and healing in the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Underlying all
of this runs an unbroken thread, common among Unitarian Universalists: our
absolute commitment to religious pluralism – not just the presence of it, but
the nurturance and celebration of it.  What we UUs have found in our religious
journeys is what Georgia O’Keefe discovered in her art:  “I thought someone
could tell me how to paint a landscape,” she said.  “But they could only tell
me how <u>they</u> painted theirs; only <u>I</u> could paint mine.”  We
passionately support each individual’s right to paint their own religious land­scape;
it is the basis of our 4<sup>th</sup> Principle: to “affirm and promote a free
and responsible search for truth and meaning.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Do we believe in God?  Some
do, and some don’t; and some will say, “Depends on your definition.”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Do we believe
in an afterlife?  Some do, and some don’t; some will say, “Depends on your
definition.”  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Are we
Christian, Humanist, Jewish, Atheist, Muslim, Buddhist, Pagan?  Yes…we are made
up of all these…and more.  That’s the beauty of us; that’s the <i>power</i> of
our movement – the power to choose, to believe what our own reason and our own
heart tell us, and even the power to say, “I don’t know.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Is that “loosey-goosey?” 
Perhaps.  But if it is, then I will proudly and with good humor wear the label.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I <u>love</u> this faith of
ours.  I love it because it encourages me to believe in an unlimited picture of
the Eternal – indefinable, but wondrous and powerful and experienced in
relationship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I love this faith because it
looks for truth not only in the Bible, but also in the Baghavad-Gita, the
Koran, the Hassidic mystics, the poets, in the beauty of the earth, and in
love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I love this faith because it
has taught me the redemptive possibilities for <u>all</u> people here on earth,
and calls me to forgiveness and reconciliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I love this faith because it
presents me with the divinity of <u>every</u> human being, not just one; and
encourages me to celebrate each person’s age, creed, ethnicity, gender, sexual
orientation, and struggles toward authentic living.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText3 style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'>          I
love this faith because its essence does not lie in any dogma, but rather in
how we live our faith and our values – how we treat each other and the earth. 
Its proof is in our deeds, not creeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          And finally, I love this
faith because it has the audacity to give each of us the freedom to say, “I
don’t know.  I thought I knew yesterday, and I may know tomorrow; but for
today, I just don’t know.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          What’s not to love?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Our world
needs a faith such as ours, which insists that love will conquer fear, and that
our work for justice will free us all.  Unitarian Universalism can serve as a
bridge between the people of the world, <u>because</u> of our openness to
diversity; ironically, the quality that leads some to call us “loosey-goosey”
is the very quality that could heal our broken world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          There will always be jokes
about Unitarian Universalists, some of which may make us wince.  But most of
these jokes spring from some very basic and wonderful truth about us. So enjoy
the jokes; have a good laugh.  Be proud of the truth to which they point.  For
it is what brought each of us into this faith; it is what engages and sustains
us. May it always bring us home to ourselves.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
