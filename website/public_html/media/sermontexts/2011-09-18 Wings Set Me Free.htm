<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>My intern committee at Horizon UU
Church in Carrollton, Texas was burdened with an enormous task. A group of five
dedicated church members with varying levels of expertise in the life of the
congregation were tasked with walking alongside me on my journey as an intern
minister. They had high hopes that we would all arrive at the end of our
journey with a newly turned out minister suitable for credentialing, ordaining
and being sent out to serve our faith. It was an enormous task.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>The task was made more enormous by the
fact that the committee was the servant of two masters. One: the Unitarian
Universalist Association, the UUA. The other: Perkins School of Theology at
Southern Methodist University. To become a UU minister I was required to
complete a full-time internship in a church. It was also a requirement of my
master of divinity degree program at Perkins. There were two internship manuals
that the committee had to be familiar with. One: a 28-page electronic document
from the UUA. The other: a 123-page binder given to all of us and my
supervising minister at an orientation provided by Perkins. I had to file two
learning serving agreements, called the learning covenant by the UUA. Each time
a report was due, which was at the mid-year point and at the end, two sets of
reports had to be filed on two different forms. The poor, overworked committee
even had two names: the UUA called them the “Intern Committee” and Perkins
called them the “Lay Teaching Committee.” As the servant of two masters, they
had two manuals, two reports, two names and even two theologies adding to the
enormity of their task.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>For the final meeting with my intern
supervisor from Perkins, (of course I had two supervisors – Dennis Hamilton,
the senior minister at Horizon and Isabel DoCampo from Perkins)….For the final
meeting the chair of my intern committee/ lay teaching committee was assigned,
in the words of Perkins School of Theology, to open the meeting with a prayer
or other devotional. The chair came to me in a panic, what did that mean? She
didn’t pray. “Other devotional?” Where would she find that material? I had been
leading our committee meetings for the last year according to the instructions
given in the Perkins internship manual, Section 4, page 18. I was to have been
modeling this behavior to her. Apparently I had not done a very good job. In
all honesty, as a committee we had decided to skip the instruction that said I
would open each meeting with a prayer or other moment of worship because we had
just come from worship. We met once a month on Sunday afternoons after the
worship service. We felt that it was redundant to have another worship moment
to begin our meeting. Being the good Unitarian Universalists that we all were,
we changed the rules.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>We opened our meetings with Unitarian
Universalist traditions. We lit the chalice and participated in a check-in,
that sacred moment where we connect on a deep level. And yes, the tradition
often includes a reading to accompany the chalice lighting. This is our living
tradition’s way of praying or sharing a devotional moment. Once I translated
this theology for my committee chair she was relieved and set off to find an
opening reading for the chalice lighting to begin our final meeting of the
year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>I had become adept at translating
Perkins Christ-centered theology into my own UU theology by the end of my seven
years in seminary. Assignments like</span> “<span lang=EN style='color:black'>Analysis
of Four Consecutive Lord’s Day Services in a Local Church” for my Word and
Worship class became “Analysis of Four Worship Services in a Local
Congregation.” Questions like “In this situation of ministry how was God’s
intention to bless all of creation disclosed?” became “In this situation of
ministry how is the person’s innate ability to ‘wake up’, to live more
consciously, disclosed?” The most challenging translation came when I was
required to write my “credo.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'> “Credo” is the final and very large
project of the required, year-long systematics course at Perkins. Systematics
is pretty much what it sounds like: a systematic approach to theology. In the
case of the course at Perkins, it is a systematic approach to Christian
theology. Credo is what it sounds like as well, being from the Latin for “I
believe.” The word originates with the Apostles’ and Nicene creeds and you will
often see it as the title of the Nicene Creed set to music. It is also what
many of our youth produce at the end of their religious education “Coming of
Age” class. Three of my daughters had gone through the Coming of Age program at
First Unitarian in Dallas, learning about Unitarian Universalism and then
producing heartfelt “I believe” statements at the end of the year shared with
the entire congregation. Here was my chance to write my own Credo, all 9,000
required words of it, and I would be faced with a daunting task of translation
made more difficult by the constraints of placing my beliefs in the context of
the proscribed Christian doctrines.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>In my first draft of the Theological
Prolegomena, academic speak for “Introduction,” to my Credo, I discovered
experience alone wouldn’t cut it as authoritative enough for my non-believer,
turned Lutheran, turned Catholic professor who once stood in front of the class
and told us we know what we know because of Christ….(He actually said “It’s
Christ all of the way down” usurping the image that it’s turtles all of the way
down from the primitive cosmological myth.) </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>I then attempted to base my entire
“Credo” on the six sources of Unitarian Universalism. In a systematic approach
to the claim, “This I believe” we are asked to ground our beliefs in a system. In
other words, from where do we draw our authority to make truth claims? If
experience alone, our first source, wasn’t authoritative enough, maybe the
entire six sources could stand as the authoritative system that could support
what I believed. Christians draw their authority to make truth claims from God
as expressed in the life and death of Jesus Christ. I attempted to argue in my
Credo that the six sources of Unitarian Universalism are a sort of system, just
as the Christian doctrines are the system that ground Christianity in beliefs
about human nature, God and salvation. It didn’t work. The six sources might
ground my Credo statement of belief for Unitarian Universalism, but I wasn’t
being asked to make a statement of my understanding of the content of Unitarian
Universalism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>I was being asked to form a
constructive statement of my own understanding of the content of the Christian
faith. I then decided to base my credo on the crossroads of experience and
reason, which was so unique to nineteenth century Unitarian Christianity.
Historian David Robinson comments on this uniqueness in his book about Ralph
Waldo Emerson. Robinson writes:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN
style='color:black'>Yet if the concept of underlying divinity of the soul, or
of the God within the individual, helps to explain the positive experience the
Unitarians linked with self-examination, the concept itself raises another
important question. Is it accurate to regard this concept as based upon the
kind of experience of the divine which Western thought has usually regarded as
mysticism? What may give pause at this idea is, of course, the long historical
association of Unitarianism with rationalism. …Champions of rationalism, the
Unitarians were also champions of religious experience. It is this uniquely
complete merger of reason and experience in theology that…sets Unitarianism
apart historically in American religion…. (David Robinson, <i>Apostle of
Culture: Emerson as Preacher and Lecturer</i>, 20.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN
style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>That was it. That was what finally
worked. After paring down my first draft of 9,821 words to 9,000, I rooted my
Credo in our UU tradition of the merger of reason with experience. After the
excruciating exercise of translating my experience through reason into the
Christian doctrines of God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, Creation, the
Church, Salvation and Eschatology I knew what my religious identity was. I am a
Unitarian Universalist. I honor the Christian roots of our faith, just as I
honor my own Christian roots having been raised as an Episcopalian. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>Since the nineteenth century we have
moved beyond Unitarian Christianity, through humanism, into a consolidation
with another liberal Christian denomination and are now a faith that looks to
six sources from which to draw inspiration. Yet, you can see our roots in many
of our worship traditions. And as the Spirit of Life blows through the
traditions of the past we move beyond our history on the winds of change. We
light candles just as people have been lighting candles in places of worship
for thousands of years. We take that tradition and create a new one: the
flaming chalice has been a symbol of our faith for 65 years. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>We reflect on readings and base our
sermons on inspired texts just as Christian preachers base their sermons each
Sunday on biblical texts. The Spirit of Life blows through that tradition
creating a new one: our readings come from the words and deeds of prophetic
women and men, all of the world’s religions, humanist teachings and
Earth-centered traditions. We gather in community, just as people of faith have
gathered for thousands of years. We call that tradition by many names: church,
fellowship, society, congregation…. We continue the tradition of hymn singing.
The Spirit of Life comes onto us and we change the words….</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>The story of Carolyn McDade’s “Spirit
of Life” is a cautionary tale. We think of this hymn as ours, one written by a
Unitarian Universalist. In the mind of its composer it’s more of a prayer than
a hymn and she is not a Unitarian Universalist. It became a part of our living
tradition even before it was published in our hymnal, “Singing the Living
Tradition.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>Many congregations sing it every
Sunday, just like a Christian churches sing the Doxology. In our free
association of autonomous congregations we created a new tradition that
expresses who we are today as Unitarian Universalists. And then we tried to
change the words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>We took what to Carolyn McDade was a
very personal prayer and added our own words to it. Not trusting in the power
of her words or the power of being acted upon by something larger than
ourselves, we thought more should be sung. Carolyn McDade asks us to find our
own melody, not to lose what we want to sing but to find a way to make it our
own. In finding our own melody, in creating new traditions we can use her
prayer as a guide. “Roots hold me close.” Honoring our past gives us access to
a rich history with roots that run as deep as the beginnings of Christianity.  “Wings
set me free.” In heeding Emerson’s words, “not to do, but to let do; not to
work, but to be worked upon” we are carried by the spirit of love and life into
a future of our own imagining.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>For the final meeting of my lay
teaching committee/intern committee, the chair honored our Unitarian
Universalist living tradition by lighting the chalice and reading the poem “A
Gift” by Denise Levertov. I had never read the poem nor heard it read aloud,
and as the chair began to read I realized she was offering a gift to me, the
perfect summation of our year in ministry. This tradition of ours as Unitarian
Universalists to treat poetry as scripture is rooted in the writings of the Hebrew
psalmists and freed by the modern language of contemporary poet/prophets. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>The medieval Christian tradition of
Lectio Divina invites the practice of a way of praying with scripture that
opens the reader or listener into a deeper experience. Translating Lectio
Divina into our living tradition, it becomes deep listening, a way of listening
for truth from many sources. Listen deeply again to</span></p>
