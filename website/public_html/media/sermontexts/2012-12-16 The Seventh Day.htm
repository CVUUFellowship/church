<title>When Paul sent a letter to the Christian's in Rome He wrote saying this,
“For by the grace given to me I say to every one of you not to think more
highly of yourself than you ought to think, but to think with sober
discernment, as God has distributed to</title>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had
done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work he had done. So God
blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the
work that he had done in creation” (Gen 2:2-3). The poetic language of these
verses was specifically chosen by the priestly writers of Genesis, writing to
the Jews of the Babylonian exile. Creation stories were used in Babylonian
worship to affirm a created order in the face of the chaos of the ancient
world. As we face the chaos of a world we have created, a world we take
responsibility for creating, we gather in worship to make sense again of
violence that is in fact senseless. We gather in worship to affirm that together
we create order in the face of chaos. In worship we share an intimacy that
reminds us of our common humanity, our common heartache, and our ability to
heal. In worship we learn to love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This morning’s sermon is the second exploring the theme of
Sabbath, specifically the Judeo-Christian tradition of Sabbath that includes both
rest and worship. Last week we considered what it is to practice a personal
Sabbath in a way that ritualizes the chaos of modern life. This week we look to
worship, the communal ritual that asks us to enter into a time set aside for
contemplation, renewal and if we dare, transformation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I learned early on in my ministry that worship is one of
those words that irritate some Unitarian Universalists. For some it implies
subservience to a god that orders all of life, a god that decrees that some
should live and some should die.  I was going to unpack that word for those
among us who are battered and bruised by worship experiences that tell us what
to believe. I was going to remind us all that the word worship is from the Middle
English woerscippen, the root of the word worth. Worship simply asks us to
consider things of worth. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>As I sat before my blank page Friday, reports started
coming in from Newtown Connecticut where a 20-year-old man killed his mother,
drove her car to a local elementary school and killed 26 people, including 20
young children, and then took his own life. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We are shocked and we are saddened. And some of us are
heading for church. Friday night, in that small Connecticut town, vigils were
held in many houses of worship. Across the nation places of worship opened
their doors Saturday for people to sit and pray, to weep, to be held in the quiet
of a place set aside for honoring what we value. Today the President is
attending an interfaith vigil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Of course we have learned that even places of worship are
not safe. On August 5<sup>th</sup> of this year a white supremacist who
associated with neofascist groups walked into a Sikh temple killing six and
wounding four others before turning the gun on himself. On July 27, 2008, a man
fired a shotgun at members of the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist
Church during a youth performance of a musical, killing two people and wounding
seven others. He stated to police “that he had targeted the church because of
its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because
they were ruining the country” (<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville_Unitarian_Universalist_church_shooting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville_Unitarian_Universalist_church_shooting</a>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The motivation of the young man who killed in Connecticut
is still not clear. It has been reported that his brother said he suffered from
some sort of “personality disorder.” The debate rises up again and bounces back
and forth between access to guns and gun owners’ rights, the need for
background checks, and the dismantling of the mental healthcare system more
than 20 years ago that has left a vulnerable population without proper care.
Preliminary reports indicate that the guns used in Connecticut belonged to the
troubled man’s mother. The issue of background checks may not even apply in
this case. Easy access to guns may be more the issue in this case. Access to assault-type
rifles that can be reloaded often and quickly may be the real point in this
case and other recent massacres. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Some have named this evil. If by evil they mean a society
that condones revenge and violent responses to violence, then yes let’s name
this evil. If by evil they mean the mentally unstable do not get proper care,
then yes let’s name this evil. If by evil they mean the constant barrage of
mind-numbing violence that dominates our headlines, then yes let’s name this
evil. Last year handguns killed 48 people in Japan, 8 in Great Britain, 34 in
Switzerland, 52 in Canada, 58 in Israel, 21 in Sweden, 42 in West Germany, and
10,728 in the United States of America. If this is what they mean by evil, then
yes let’s name this evil.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Some have said that their god could have protected the
victims from this evil, but their god does not go where he isn’t wanted. If we
feared a god that judges us, some have said, then we would not commit acts of
violence. If we allowed prayer in schools, their god would protect our
children, some have said. What we need, some have said, is a change of heart,
not a change in the law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that, “A person will worship
something, have no doubt about that. We may think our tribute is paid in secret
in the dark recesses of our hearts, but it will out. That which dominates our
imaginations and our thoughts will determine our lives, and our character.
Therefore, it behooves us to be careful what we worship, for what we are worshipping
we are becoming.” When we worship a god that doesn’t show up to protect
children from a violent death, we are worshipping a false god, an idol. I agree
that we need a change of heart. We need to replace our hardened, judgmental
hearts with a heart broken wide open by the pain of our failure to protect our
children. Yes, we need a change of heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We also need to be careful what we worship as a nation.
When we worship individual freedom at the cost of interdependence and
interconnectedness, we are worshipping a false god, an idol. When we worship
the god of corporate profit, we worship a gun lobby that only answers to gun
manufacturers who only answer to shareholders. When we worship fear, we worship
at an altar built by a small and diminished humanity. “It behooves us to be
careful what we worship, for what we are worshipping we are becoming.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>It has been said that when all of the concrete gods have
been destroyed, the divine remains. When we stop worshipping false, concrete
gods, many of us stop worshipping altogether and we stop coming to church. Many
outside our faith ask, “What do Unitarian Universalists worship?” in the same
way they ask, “What do Unitarian Universalists believe?” Here are better
questions to ask. These are questions we can ask ourselves on a regular basis:
“How do Unitarian Universalists worship?” and “Why do Unitarian Universalists
worship?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Poet, prophet, humanist and UU minister Kenneth Patton
invites us to “worship with our eyes and ears and fingertips.” We worship
leaving room for mystery. We worship looking to each other for answers. “Let us
worship,” Patton wrote and “let us learn to love.” We are not so arrogant to
assume we already know how to love when we bring our entire selves to the
worship experience. We do not worship a god who abandons young children as
punishment for some perceived collective sin. We worship, wanting to learn how
twenty murdered children can teach us to love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>UU minister the Rev. Dr. Victoria Weinstein tells a funny
story about a phone call she received one morning just prior to the church
service. The caller wanted to know what the topic was for the day. She blurted
out, “Come to Church Anyway!” and then lamely had to admit what the actual
topic was. “Come to Church Anyway” would have been my central theme for this
sermon before Friday morning, before a gunman shattered the quiet of a small
New England town. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Come to church when you are too tired to come to church, I
would have said. Come to church when you cannot stand the topic. Come to
church, anyway. Come to church when your life is falling apart. Come to church
when your life isn’t falling apart. Come to church anyway, I would have said
before the phone call from my daughter telling me to watch the news coming out
of Newtown. You do not know what pain hides behind your neighbor’s smile, I
would have said. Come to church because how we worship and why we worship is
lessened by your absence. Come be a part of the shared silence of our
meditation. Come be a part of an intimacy that reminds us of our common
humanity, our common heartache, and our ability to heal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Now even the category called the “nones” are probably
showing up for church today – those who check the box “none” when asked to
identify which religion they practice. According to a recent study one in five
adults have no religious affiliation at all. According to the Pew Research
Center the number of Americans who do not identify with any religion continues
to grow at a rapid pace. One-fifth of the U.S. public – and a third of adults
under 30 – are religiously unaffiliated today, the highest percentages ever. I
could tell you that that is what is wrong with our country, that if more of us
were affiliated with a religion that there would be less violence in the world.
This is simply not true. I know that violence done in the name of religion is
what keeps so many people away from church. I know that naming god as an
omnipotent, omnipresent, punishing parent keeps people away, too. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I hope “the nones” are attending a house of worship today.
It is dark days like these that we need to light a candle and sing a song of
hope. On a day like today, it is appropriate to say, despite all of the flaws
of religion and a mixed-up humanity who continues to worship false gods, “Come
to Church Anyway!” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>It is dark days like this one that answer the question,
“why do we worship?” We worship because we need to learn how to love. What we
worship we are becoming. When we worship, we are learning to love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Today we remember all of the victims of the tragedy in Connecticut.
We remember those who died and those who mourn. We mourn for our nation as we
make sense of the senseless and speak out for the defenseless. We remember that
what we worship we are becoming. When we worship we are learning to love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
