<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'> <span lang=EN>It started more than a year ago. It
started with carefully choosing a search committee, with completing a survey,
with cottage conversations. It started with the ending of one ministry, knowing
that beginnings are in endings and identity is defined through change. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>The Conejo Valley Unitarian Universalist Fellowship started
when six couples looking for a liberal religious oasis for themselves and a
religious education home for their children gathered in December of 1961. We
will celebrate our official 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary in February, which
marks the moment the congregation joined the UUA as the Tri-Valley Unitarian
Universalist Fellowship. Since that time, the Fellowship has grown from those
six couples to more than 200 members. There have been seven part-time
consulting ministers who have worked closely with lay leaders since 1967 to
establish programs and provide worship. In 2000 the Fellowship called its first
full-time settled minister, the Rev. Dr. Betty Stapleford. Today you will
install your second full-time settled minister.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>Whether you are a first-time visitor or a long-time
member you can participate in this historic event. All are invited this
afternoon to celebrate the birth of our new ministry. All are invited to
experience how a covenantal faith calls us to the fullest expression of our
deepest selves. Lorella Hess, one of the members of the ministerial search
committee and the installation committee, pointed out this odd fact to me: I
was ordained by my home congregation, the First Unitarian Church of Dallas on
Sunday, February 13<sup>th</sup>. Just nine months later, on Sunday November 13<sup>th</sup>
I am being installed as your newly settled minister. Please join us this
afternoon for a celebration of my new life and our new life together: the birth
of our new ministry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>Our journey towards this moment started with a search
committee, a survey, cottage conversations and a process that’s a lot like
online dating. I viewed your online profile. You viewed my online profile. We
decided we liked what we saw and did what everyone does after a first date: we
got to know each other better. We “exchanged packets” – pages and pages and
pages of information designed to make us both want to continue our online
romance. The online part of our romance concluded with an interview and then we
decided to meet face-to-face. The whirlwind weekend we spent together went so
well that we both decided to make a commitment. It was time to meet the rest of
the family. After spending the week together in April, the family voted and I
said yes. I have been living with you since August 15<sup>th</sup> and this
afternoon we are getting married. Marriage and birth can be central to the
human life cycle. They can also be appropriate imagery for the church life
cycle. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>Like marriage, the installation of a minister
acknowledges a sacred covenant. It is a promise to be in relationship in a
particular way. You will hear the echoes of marriage vows this afternoon as we
make our promises to each other. Like birth, the calling of a new minister
welcomes a new member into a church family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>The installation is an opportunity to re-commit to the
mission of this Fellowship and the mission of Unitarian Universalism. It is
also an opportunity to re-commit to something larger than both this
congregation and our religious movement. It is an opportunity to reconnect to a
greater sense of purpose, to “</span><span style='line-height:200%'>discover
the community of our lives” as Parker Palmer puts it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>Knowing that beginnings are in endings and identity is
defined through change, I thought today would be the perfect time to announce
our new mission statement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>From the start, you made it clear that you wanted to
embrace a new identity. In your congregational record, that online statement
that made me want to go on our first date, this is what your ministerial search
committee said about you: “</span><span style='line-height:200%'>While our
diverse mix of people and interests is an attractive attribute, it also has
produced</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>a somewhat diffuse sense of mission and purpose. During our current
period of transition,</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>CVUUF has undertaken a profound review of who we are,
how we do things, and what we</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>want to be in the future. There is a clear desire in
the congregation for a minister who will</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>rally us around a strong sense of shared mission,
vision, and values.” You said this in our start-up weekend with District
Executive Ken Brown: “we want a greater sense of mission; we need a clear,
inspiring mission; and we want a shared sense of mission.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>Just as you empowered your leaders on the search
committee to find me, you empowered me along with the board of trustees to
define our new mission. Before I announce it, let me first tell you how we
discovered the new mission. Better said, let me tell you how we uncovered the
new mission. You remember the survey and the cottage conversations that helped
write the online identity that I fell in love with? Just a few weeks ago, the
board and I uncovered our new mission there in your words. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>We found the new mission in statements that you made
about what this church means to you. We found the new mission arising naturally
from stories of how this church has changed you. And we found the new mission
in the stories you told us about why you came here in the first place, and why you
stayed. Here are some of the things you told us:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>“It’s a place where you’re encouraged to find
yourself.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%'>“</span><span style='line-height:200%'>I came for RE,
for a place where my</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>child could be different and not suffer for</span><span
style='line-height:200%'> </span><span style='line-height:200%'>it, could ask
questions without fear. I</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>didn’t expect it, but I found good friends</span><span
style='line-height:200%'> </span><span style='line-height:200%'>for myself.
There are good people here</span><span style='line-height:200%'> </span><span
style='line-height:200%'>doing good work.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>“There is a tremendous community, a level of
connection to people that I don’t find in other places and parts of my life.
They are very caring people and I feel a part of it.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>“I like being opened up to alternative ways to think
about things.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>“A place to bring children that is spiritual but
without dogma.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>“I joined originally for more liberal values in a
conservative community primarily for my kids. The truth is I have been the most
involved one in my family.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>“Faith in Action is our commitment to be there when
important things come up - like Prop 8 - and we line up with people to make a
difference in the world.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>“Having a place for others to discover that they are
not alone with their UU values and can actively participate and practice their
values in this community.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>“I value the fellowship, members who basically stand
on the same ground and look for a meaningful life.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>“I like the whole mix of seeing everyone else happily
involved and finding meaning in their lives and making a difference in the
lives of others.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>The board and I listened to what was said last year
and what was captured by the survey. I listened to what you said to me in the
one-on-one conversations we’ve been having. We read other Unitarian
Universalist mission statements. We paid attention to our Association’s
tagline: “Nurture your spirit. Help heal the world.” We also took to heart
these words from UU author and church consultant Michael Durall: “…the language
of a congregation’s mission or vision statement is vitally important if that
congregation genuinely wishes to live out its call to ministry. A mission
statement reveals the nature and character of that congregation, its place in
the world, and what the future might hold” (<i>The Almost Church Revitalized</i>,
p. 81).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>Before I tell you our new mission, I’d like all of you
to turn your order of service over and look at the old mission statement. Now
get out a pen or a pencil, you may have to borrow one from your neighbor, and
cross through the old mission statement. Write this down: The mission of the
Conejo Valley Unitarian Universalist Fellowship is to “nurture spiritually
courageous people who transform the world through justice and compassion.”
That’s it. Twelve words. These 12 words will guide everything we do together
from this day forward. These 12 words ask us to dream, not to wish. These 12
words ask us to take responsibility for ourselves and for the world we will
leave our children. Take these 12 words home with you today, put them on your
refrigerator door, pin them to a bulletin board. Look at them every day and
start to live from this mission, our mission that calls us to our shared
ministry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>Writer, teacher and activist Parker Palmer points out
that [Frederick] Buechner’s  definition of vocation “starts with the self and
moves toward the needs of the world: it begins, wisely, where vocation begins –
not in what the world needs (which is everything), but in the nature of the
human self, in what brings the self joy, the deep joy of knowing that we are
here on earth to be the gifts that God created” (<i>Let Your Life Speak</i>, p.
16-17). Just as true vocation starts with the self and moves toward the needs
of the world, our mission starts with the self – the spiritually courageous
individual – and moves toward the needs of the world: justice and compassion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>Henry Hampton says that Unitarian Universalists don’t
dream – they wish. I think this can be said about most people. Wishing comes
from starting with what we think the world needs. Dreaming comes when we start
with our own healing, our own joy and discover how our true, authentic self can
create the world as we would really have it. When we start with what the world
needs we can sometimes ignore our own needs, trying to fix the world from the
“hole” in our own soul. When we do this there is a disconnection between our
deep knowing and the work we do in the world. Finding true vocation, one’s
personal mission, can be as easy as is like breathing in and breathing out. We
breathe in: this is the discovery of the self. We breathe out; this is our
effort to share what we have discovered with the world. Breathing in and
breathing out, the body is whole. Breathing in we nurture our own spirit,
breathing out we share our spirit with the world. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>Our mission – to nurture spiritually courageous people
who transform the world through justice and compassion – welcomes all who walk
though these doors. Whether you are here for your children or here for
yourself, or think you’re here for your children and then discover you are here
for yourself, we welcome you to a spiritually courageous life. Whether you
stand on the corner carrying a sign or stand in the kitchen cooking for the
homeless, we welcome you to transform the world through justice and compassion.
We welcome you who come through these doors looking for safe harbor during the
storms of your life and invite you to ask with us “the question of selfhood and
answer it as honestly as [you] can, no matter where it takes [you]” knowing, “Only
as we do so can we discover the community of our lives” (Palmer).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>The next time someone asks you what church you belong
to, tell them you belong to a church that “nurtures spiritually courageous
people who transform the world through justice and compassion.” Incorporate our
mission into your life. Measure our success not in numbers, but by how well we
travel from self to service, how well we understand that your vocation and our
mission start with the self and move toward the needs of the world.</span></p>
