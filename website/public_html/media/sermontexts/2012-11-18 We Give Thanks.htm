<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The words of this Thanksgiving song conjure up a
traditional American scene: the meal as the center of giving thanks. The meal
as the magnet, pulling us home to friend and family. The meal as the center of
a celebration that welcomes all, drawing in family, friend and friendless into
a circle of loving kindness - the circle that begins and ends in gratitude.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Three years ago was the last Thanksgiving I spent with my
family. I have a new tradition now. Having moved from Texas, waiting for my
husband to retire and join me here in California, and knowing how impossible it
is to gather the family from near and far for two holidays each year, I am
grateful for the sheltered place I find myself in this time of year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Three years ago my sister insisted the entire family gather
together. This was a rare request. We had given up on gathering our growing
families in Houston at my mother’s house for both Thanksgiving and Christmas. We
had created our own holiday that takes place sometime in January. Attendance at
“Christmas in January” rises and falls over the years. New significant others
are added and subtracted; children in college drift in and out as their
schedules become more complicated, divorces and marriages, births and deaths
have shaped our gatherings. Last year we welcomed my new grandniece. This year we
may not gather at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Even as the Christmas holiday was becoming more difficult
to keep, Thanksgiving became altogether impossible. So we gave up. Three years
ago it was different.  It was the first holiday without my mother. My sister
insisted that we all show up this one time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I would like to tell you that we had a Thanksgiving
gathering worthy of the Waltons, including the sweet sounds of “goodnight Johnboy”
echoing through the halls. Knowing that we would be gathering at the house my
nephew shared with two roommates at Texas A&amp;M University, I had packed the
double air mattress. My daughters stretched out on the living room couch. My
nephews were in sleeping bags on the floor. Sharing the air mattress placed on
the floor near them, my husband and I were pitched about on a rough sea each
time our slightest move displaced the air beneath us. I’m sure one of us yelled
out “goodnight Johnboy,” ironically acknowledging our gathered family in that
room and scattered throughout the house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This was perhaps the only way we could express gratitude
for our gathered family that year. Our grief was all too new, too raw. We hid
behind mountains of food; the only emotion expressed was anguish over the
annual football match-up between our rival universities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The following year I started my new tradition of sharing
Thanksgiving with my church family. I joined five members of the Pocatello,
Idaho Fellowship and drove up to the Idaho Falls church for their community
Thanksgiving. I, thankfully, did not drive. I add thankfully with emphasis
because truly the fact that I didn’t drive the icy freeway between Pocatello
and Idaho Falls rose to the top of my gratitude list as we counted the cars
that had slid off the highway and got stuck in the piled snow on the side of
the road.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I say gratitude list like I actually keep one; I don’t. I
have a friend who keeps a gratitude journal and highly recommends the practice.
I know that many Facebook users have been practicing 30 days of gratitude this
November. It is good that we set aside a whole day for thanks giving each year.
All of these practices can remind us how to become a person who feels
gratitude. “The Buddha said that two things are remarkably rare in this world:
people who benefit others, and people who feel gratitude,” according to Joseph
Goldstein (Insight Meditation, p. 145). We can reflect on our lives and
generate authentic gratitude, but it takes practice. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The Apostle Paul, writing to the Thessalonians in what is
probably the oldest Christian document in existence, tells them to “rejoice
always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances” (1 Thes
5:16-18). This is the portion of the letter where Paul tells the church at
Thessalonica how to behave. He does this in all of his letters, particularly
when members of the church are misbehaving. In this letter Paul tells the early
Christians to be grateful, among other behaviors. Not only are they to be
grateful, rejoice always and to pray without ceasing; they are also to refrain
from quenching the Spirit, they are to test the word of the prophets by looking
for what is good and they are also to trust that which calls them forward in
their lives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>But, give thanks in all circumstances….really, all? That
would have been my response if I had been among the churchgoers listening to
Paul’s letter being read aloud after it had arrived. I have an easier time
hearing “pray without ceasing” than I do “give thanks in all circumstances.” When
I hear that I am to “pray without ceasing” I also hear the seventh step on the
Noble Eightfold Path: right mindfulness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Right mindfulness becomes a prayer when it leads us from
attention to appreciation. Mindfulness awakens us to levels of perceiving where
gratitude becomes possible. Gratitude flows naturally out of paying attention
to what is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The 13<sup>th</sup> Century Persian mystical poet Rumi
tells us to “be grateful for whoever comes.” He uses the metaphor of a guest
house to describe the human condition. He lists the unwanted guests of
depression, meanness, and sorrow alongside the guests that are easier to
entertain. We cannot shut out the unwanted guests. Gratitude gives equal weight
to all who visit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Author and UU minister Kate Braestrup writes:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>            Genuine gratitude, the
gratitude of prayer, must ultimately arise out of a profound recognition that <i>things
could be other than what they are</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:black'>            </span>If
you will forgive a small diversion into a kind of mysticism – (she writes) things
could <i>not be</i>. At all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>            Yet here you are!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:black'>            </span>And
here I am! <i>How cool is this?</i><span style='color:black'> (<i>Beginner’s
Grace: Bringing Prayer to Life</i>)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This is not to say
that we express gratitude because “things could be worse.” We express gratitude
out of a profound sense of existential astonishment. We are grateful just to
exist. To express this existential gratitude we can start small. We can start
by appreciating something that is easy to appreciate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This is the logic behind metta meditation. In metta, or
loving-kindness, meditation we begin with someone we already love, with someone
we appreciate, someone for whom it is easy for us to be grateful. We could
begin with ourselves; for some this is not the easiest place to begin. We may <u>want</u>
to begin with ourselves. If we can love ourselves, be truly grateful for who we
are, then gratitude naturally flows from us to all we encounter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Starting with someone who is easy to love, we move on to
someone who is neutral, then someone who is difficult to love. As we practice
loving-kindness as a meditation, as a prayer without ceasing, genuine gratitude
for all that is begins to be a part of who we are. Giving thanks in all
circumstances begins to make sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Just as the unwanted guests of negativity, shame and malice
show up on the metaphorical steps of our personal guest house, the holidays can
bring unwanted reminders of broken relationships and unresolved pain from our
past. Rarely do we give thanks in those circumstances, adding a page to our
journal giving thanks for an abusive relationship or a lost job. Start with
someone who is easy to love. Start with some thing that is easy to love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I remember another Thanksgiving. My husband’s mother had
fallen and broken her hip. She was in a nursing home for rehabilitation.
Thankfully, she was only there for a short while before she was discharged to
home care. The tradition on this side of the family was that Frank and I hosted
the Thanksgiving dinner. Frank’s mother and father hosted Christmas Eve dinner,
which always featured Cuban rice and beans and flan for dessert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Frank’s mother liked a traditional Thanksgiving dinner so
we stopped off at the local cafeteria before our planned visit with her. If you
are wondering what kind of ungrateful children bring their mother cafeteria
food for Thanksgiving, let me briefly explain that Texas has a long tradition of
home style cooking that comes from well-known, well-loved cafeterias. We
stopped at my mother-in-law’s favorite cafeteria to pick up Thanksgiving dinner
for her that day. It was the quietest Thanksgiving dinner we have ever had. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>If you don’t already know this, let me tell you a
well-known fact that had escaped me until I married into the Peña family:
Cubans are loud. Most holiday dinners include my father-in-law’s customary
announcement of the news of the day; one year that meant he read to us from an
article he had clipped from the newspaper listing everything he thought we
needed to know about turkeys before he carved ours. Politics are always
discussed, loudly, with differing opinions flying around the room like shots
fired in a crowded bar.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This Thanksgiving was different. Frank, his brother, his
father and I quietly visited while his mother ate her Thanksgiving dinner out
of Styrofoam containers. Surprisingly, there were leftovers from this dinner
for one. Frank and I gratefully ate them the next day, noticing how the detail
of leftovers after Thanksgiving gave a sense of normal to such an awkward
holiday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Both our mothers are gone now. It would be easy to put at
the top of our lists that we are grateful that they gave birth to us. That is
the obvious place to start, the existential gratitude that all human beings can
start with. I would rather start small, appreciating the trivial, like my
mother’s sweater I wore to keep me warm while I wrote this sermon or my mother-in-law’s
winter coat that I kept in the car for emergencies when I did drive the snowy
roads by myself in Idaho.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>On the way to the Idaho Falls church for Thanksgiving
dinner the driver of our car spotted a red-tailed hawk. In her excitement, she
steered in the same direction the hawk was flying. For a brief moment her car
left the safety of the plowed and sanded part of the road. As she adeptly
maneuvered us back onto the freeway, the car hit a patch of ice. Thankfully we
did not add to the number of cars that day that had ended up headlong into a
fence or stuck in a snowdrift. The slip was momentary, the hawk was gone and we
were once again heading towards Idaho Falls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>As you can imagine, this story was told and told again to
the group who gathered for the church’s community Thanksgiving. Each time the
telling became more dramatic. At one point in the telling a scream was added to
the part where the car hit the patch of ice. Those of us sitting in the back
seat were supposedly responsible for this scream. I don’t think <u>I</u>
screamed. What they heard coming from the back seat, if indeed they heard
anything, was probably a deep exclamation of thanks giving.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>That’s the way I chose to tell the story on our way home.
Grateful for the hawk, the adeptness of the driver and yes, even for the ice.
Grateful for the shared laughter on the way home, we gave thanks for all we had
been given that day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This Thanksgiving may we all be pulled into the circle of
loving kindness, the circle that begins and ends with gratitude.</span></p>
