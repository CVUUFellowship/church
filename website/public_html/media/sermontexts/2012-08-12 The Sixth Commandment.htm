<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The sixth commandment from the Hebrew Scriptures: You
must not kill. You must not kill. It seems obvious enough and in the King
James’ version I grew up hearing in church “Thou shalt not kill,” it seems even
more obvious, almost more substantial in that antiquated language. What is so
hard then, about this commandment? We have been told not to kill. Why then, do
we continue to kill?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>First of all, some of us have not grown up with this
version of the commandment. Some of us, it seems, have grown up with the
alternative translation, “you must not murder.” Well, okay then. I can do that.
That’s not so hard. And so now I don’t have to get into heated arguments with
people over capital punishment and war because those aren’t murder. Because
obviously the Hebrew Bible sanctions capital punishment and we all know there
is plenty of war going on in all those stories of Israel’s history. Well, this
seems easy then. We can just go on living in our violent world and when some
bad person murders someone we’ll just have them killed and when one country
attacks us we’ll just go and attack them back. I can’t imagine any one in this
room is comfortable with that interpretation. Some of us have heard this
commandment as “you must not kill” or “Thou shalt not kill.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In a world with so much killing it is worth looking
at the translation of this one very powerful word in Hebrew:  <i>ratsach.</i> The
note to Exodus 20:13 in the Jewish Study Bible states, “You shall not murder:
This refers to illicit killing. The King James Version’s “thou shalt not kill”
is too broad; it implies that even capital punishment and war are prohibited,
whereas the Torah mandates these.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Yet, the Hebrew verb can be translated either “kill”
or “murder,” and this same verb is used to describe many types of killing in
the Hebrew Scriptures, intentional and unintentional. If we hear this
commandment as “you must not kill” we are forced to hear its dissonance in a
world filled with terrorists (domestic and foreign alike), campus shootings and
war. In music, dissonance is that moment where two notes bump up against each
other. The tones are so close it is almost painful to hear and, if you sing in
a choir, you know you cannot hold on to dissonant notes for long. Dissonance
must be resolved.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Cognitive dissonance is that psychological state
that describes the uncomfortable feeling between what one holds to be true and
what one knows to be true. We hold it to be true that one must not kill, not
because it has been commanded by God, but because in the depths of our beings
we know that to take another life is completely contrary to what it means to be
alive. And yet….What we know to be true is that we live in a violent world.
Every day we read in the paper another story of a violent murder and I know it
crosses all of our minds, “that murderer deserves to die.” And we experience
dissonance. We cannot hold onto this dissonance for long. Dissonance demands to
be resolved.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>Instead of resolving it however, we ignore
it. We cover our ears and stop listening. We become unaffected. Last Sunday I
sat in front of my computer after a very satisfying day of worship here. We
celebrated a successful Justice General Assembly. We heard stories of Unitarian
Universalists as the “love people” who went to Phoenix to stand on the side of
love with the detainees at tent city. After that celebration of so much love
and justice, I sat in front of my computer and read the headline: “Shooting at
Sikh Temple in Wisconsin Leaves at Least Seven Dead.” This headline had replaced
the follow-up headlines of the shooting in Aurora, Colorado and the photos of
the orange-haired, wild-eyed gunman that had been dominating news coverage for
more than two weeks.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>People were still killing and being killed,
but the details had changed. This is how killing comes to us today – in
headlines and sound bites. How many are dead today in Syria? In Afghanistan? We
don’t know. Those headlines have been buried behind headlines of killing of a
different kind. Arguments over access to guns, exposure to violent movies and
the proliferation of hate groups – these are our headlines today. No wonder we
prefer to hear “you must not murder,” rather than “you must not kill.” The
dissonance is deafening.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>Even those of us who grew up without hearing
scripture read on Sunday morning have been taught by the dominant culture to accept
a reading of the sixth commandment as “you must not murder” rather than “you
must not kill.” We resolve the dissonance by closing our ears to the
commandments as part of a biblical tradition we reject. We label ourselves
pacifists and become Unitarian Universalists who see our seven principles as a
modern improvement on the Ten Commandments. The Rev. Dr. Paul Rasor, a
Unitarian Universalist theologian, invokes our seven principles when he writes:
“Beneath our individuality and our enormous diversity lies a profound
relationality – an interdependent web – that connects us. This unity helps us
envision a world in which there is no Other to war against.” We can envision
this world, but this world does not yet exist. We are not off the hook just
because we proclaim ourselves a part of the interdependent web of existence. We
cannot easily resolve the deafening dissonance of impersonal killing reduced to
a changing headline on a web site. As Unitarian Universalists we are called to
live a little longer with dissonance, to sit with the questions, to struggle
with paradox.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>Wade Michael Page, the man responsible for
the deaths last Sunday at the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin played in
heavy-metal bands that promote violence against religious and ethnic
minorities. Reports state that “Page had immersed himself in a skinhead music
scene that is small yet virulent and off the radar screen of most Americans.”
This music was off my radar screen until I served a congregation in Pocatello,
Idaho. Three years ago, music CDs with a graphic photo of a lynching started
showing up on sidewalks in downtown Pocatello and placed on cars parked on the
campus of Idaho State University. Some were even placed on the doorways of the
local high school. The CDs were filled with music like the kind Page played,
music with lyrics promoting Neo-Nazism and calling for the murder of all Jews
and all Blacks. An interfaith alliance of Methodists, Mormons, United Church of
Christ members and Unitarian Universalists began meeting with other concerned
citizens to make the public aware that white supremacist groups were coming in
from the margins and making their presence known. Three years later the group
still meets with the goal of placing these hate groups on the radar of this
university town in Idaho. Now when these music CDs mysteriously show up on doorways,
sidewalks and parked cars the police are notified. The public is warned. This
underworld of hate is exposed to the light of day.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>Page was also in the Army. Although he never
saw combat, he most certainly learned to kill. He may have also learned how to
identify someone as “other,” splitting himself off from any possibility of
connection, becoming numb to a reading of the sixth commandment as “you must
not kill.” When we send our young men and women to war we ask them to resolve
their own cognitive dissonance about killing by ignoring what they know to be
true: you must not kill and if you must there is a way to do it that honors the
web of life.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>As contradictory as this seems, this is the
thesis of Viet Nam War veteran Karl Marlantes’ book <i>What It is Like to Go to
War. </i>“In war, we have to live with heavy contradictions,” he writes.
“Warriors must touch their souls because their job involves killing people.
Warriors deal with eternity.” He examines the <i>Mahabharata</i>, “the classic
Indian epic, which was first preserved around AD 400 but has its roots
centuries earlier in the mythologies of the Indo-Aryan invaders and the people
they conquered…” </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>In the tale, the warrior hero Arjuna looks
out over the battlefield and sees the friends and family he is about to face in
battle. Even though his kith and kin have embodied evil, he cannot go against
his nature and kill them. Krishna, disguised as his charioteer, tries several
different ways to persuade Arjuna. “Even two thousand years ago it was
understood that appeals to manhood and social duties were not sufficient to
kill our brothers on the other side,” Marlantes writes. “Krishna presses
forward, this time appealing to religion, usually a surefire persuader.” But it
doesn’t work. Ultimately Krishna persuades Arjuna to enter the battle because
we do not yet live in a world in which there is no Other to war against. We
live in a world where evil exists, injustice occurs. And when it does, warriors
are asked to choose sides. It is better to choose a side with as much knowledge
as possible. Blind obedience to a god or a country perpetuates the need to
ignore cognitive dissonance. Cheering our warriors on as if all they are doing
is winning a football game for our side robs them of their humanity and leads
them to confuse murder with the killing that the Hebrew Scriptures seemingly
condone. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>“In the divine play of opposites the warrior
knows only one thing for certain, that a side must be chosen,” Marlantes tells
us. He goes on to say that “Once a side is chosen, the actions have to be
dedicated to what is beyond the world of opposites.” If we are to live in this
world as it is now, not as we wish it to be someday, we can hear the sixth
commandment as “you must not kill” and honor those who kill at the same time. <u>This</u>
dissonance is resolved when we choose sides willing to be wrong, willing to
open up to the pain and the guilt. The dissonance is resolved when we recognize
the evil we see in the “other” resides just as easily in our own hearts. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>Wade Michael Page only recognized evil in the
“other.” He is not the only one. The Southern Poverty Law Center listed 1,018
hate groups in the USA in 2011, up from 602 in 2000. There are only 18 groups
in Idaho, one of which was certainly responsible for disseminating the hate
literature in Pocatello. There are 45 in my beloved home state of Texas. The
state with the most hate groups is California, with 84 identified by the
Southern Poverty Law Center.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>“Here is a story to break your heart,” the
poet Mary Oliver writes. These words open another beautiful meditation on nature
from Oliver. We are not pulled into a soft world. There is nothing safe here; the
loons are dying and we don’t know why. We can ask why or we can let our hearts
break. When the world presents its dead to us we can ask why and we can let our
hearts break, never closing again to the rest of the world.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;
background:#F8FCFF'><span lang=EN>I chose today’s topic several weeks ago, this
being the first Sunday I would have the chance to reflect on the shooting in
Aurora and the domestic violence in our River Falls congregation. Never did I
imagine there would be another incident to add to the list. It would be so easy
to numb out to the never-ending violence brought to us by ever-changing headlines.
Instead we are invited to mourn, to let our hearts break wide open with arms
outstretched encircling those we love, mourning for the whole human family.</span></p>
