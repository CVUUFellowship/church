<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I’ve never been a big
proponent of Mother’s Day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          When I was a child, I
approached it with dread, knowing that I hadn’t saved enough of my allowance to
buy anything nice for my mother like my friends were buying for theirs, and
that if I asked her what she wanted, she’d simply suggest something cheap like
a spatula. “That’s exactly what I need,” she’d insist with an earnestness that
allowed me to believe her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          When I became a mother
myself – especially after feminism began questioning some of our traditions, I
began to view Mother’s Day not only as a huge marketing campaign for Hallmark
and other merchants, but also as a cheap trick to get mothers to feel
appreciated for one day, so we might forget how <u>un</u>appreciated we felt
the other 364 days of the year! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          At some point I’d learned
about the very first Mother’s Day, on June 2<sup>nd</sup>, in 1872, when Julia
Ward Howe </span><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>led
a &quot;Mother's Day&quot; anti-war observance in New York City, at which she
read a </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Day_Proclamation"><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none'>Mother's Day Proclamation</span></a><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'> calling on
all women to denounce war. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I also learned that the
precursor to our current Mother’s Day was begun by Anna Jarvis, following the
death of her mother on May 9, 1905. Jarvis went on to campaign to establish
Mother's Day as a national holiday. Five years later, Congress passed a law
designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day, and President </span><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson"><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>Woodrow
Wilson</span></a><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>
issued a proclamation declaring the first national Mother's Day as a day for
American citizens to show the flag in honor of those mothers whose sons had
died in war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif";color:#103A99'>          </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>All of this
might have been lovely, had the idea not almost immediately gone the way of
commercialization. Apparently in less than a decade after Jarvis’ first
commemoration, the merchandizing of it had become so prevalent that Jarvis
herself said she wished she’d never started it. She hated Mother’s Day cards,
contending they were a lazy replacement for writing a real note. (I shutter to
think what she would have said about e-cards!) In 1948, Jarvis was even
arrested for disturbing the peace while protesting the holiday’s
commercialization.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And that’s how
<i>I</i> came to feel about Mother’s Day, too; it never should have been
started. Sometime during my Seminary days, I declared a war on it, and told my
kids not to bother getting me anything or doing anything special for me on that
day. And so they didn’t.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>But over the
years I’ve softened a bit. For one thing, I got tired of hearing friends tell
me what wonderful things their kids had done for them on Mother’s Day, while
I’d spent the day alone. But I also realized that it was a perfect excuse to
spend some time with my kids, and eventually grandkids! I can pretty much count
on a lunch or dinner now every Mother’s Day – combined, of course, with
honoring my daughter as a mom. But I still deplore the commercialization of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And, I refuse
to treat Mother’s Day as a Unitarian Universalist High Holy Day. I’ve warned
the Worship Committee of every church I’ve served not to automatically expect a
service related to Mother’s Day every year if I’m in the pulpit. You might just
as likely have been listening to a sermon this morning on racism in America, or
the importance of prayer in our lives – nothing related to Mother’s Day
necessarily…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>…had it not
been for the number of jokes I’ve begun noticing over the past couple of years directed
at mothers and mothers-in-law. Maybe I’d simply become acclimated to them over
the years; but I truly hadn’t noticed them for a long time. I’d come to really
believe we’d gotten past stereotyping moms as overbearing, simple-minded,
and/or creators of guilt, or mothers-in-law as judgmental, caustic, and just
downright evil. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Yet I’ve been noticing more
and more comics – especially males – making jokes, for example, about their
mother phoning them over and over for no good reason except to make them feel
guilty. On one of my favorite NPR shows, “Wait Wait, Don’t Tell Me,” the
message that Carl Sagal was supposedly going to leave on the game winner’s home
answering machine, in honor of Mother’s Day, was, “Hello, this is your mother.
I can’t answer the phone right now because I’ve just died of shock that you’ve
called!” (Funny, I know; but if there really are <i>so</i> many moms
complaining about their children not calling that this can be a common joke,
then maybe adult children need to start calling their mothers more often!)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          It’s not just men making the
jokes, of course – though it’s probably most often the male writers of comedy
shows. On one TV show a while back, a young woman refers to her mother-in-law
by saying, “She’s in Arizona – or on the phone, gently telling us how we should
live our lives!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Of course, mothers and
mothers-in-law aren’t only <i>joked </i>about. Many TV dramas I’ve seen at some
point have the mother of a main character visit, and she’s always either
demeaning to the character, or meddling in their life, is alcoholic or mentally
ill. I don’t know when the last time was that I saw a mother or mother-in-law
depicted as someone I’d want to spend time with.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          And so I wonder: Is this how
it’s always been, and for some reason I’d just stopped paying attention? Or is
it some kind of new backlash, and if so, against <i>what</i>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Is it part of the more
serious attack on women that we’re seeing in the political attempts to control
women’s health care and our ability to make our own choices about that care? Or
is it <u>that</u> which is causing me to flinch more when I hear these jokes
against mothers and mothers-in-law – another form of discounting and
disempowering women?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          All I ever wanted to be when
I was growing up was a mom. I used to imagine finding an abandoned baby on our
family’s doorstep, and my parents allowing me to be its primary caregiver. But
when I finally <u>did</u> have a child of my own, I learned how incredibly challenging
it was – and that no one – not even Dr. Spock – could really tell me how to do
it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>I was
overwhelmed with my first child, having just turned 21 the week before she was
born. My husband was a full-time student with a full-time busboy job at night, and
with several years of grad school ahead; we were very poor and very stressed
out. And I was simply too young to be a mom; I’d had no idea how difficult it
could be. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>By the time I
gave birth to our son – over seven years later, we were better off financially,
and could afford for me to stop working and be a stay-at-home mom. And I did
that for a while, and was a much better mother to him than I had been to my
daughter. But finally I returned to work in an office part-time, as I just
wasn’t cut out to stay home. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>A year after
our son was born, my husband and I separated, and I got to find out what it’s
like to be a <i>single</i> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>mother, working outside the home
full-time, and juggling that with picking up the kids from school, child care,
etc.; again, a huge challenge! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          So, like many of you, I’ve
experienced being a married mother with a paid job outside the home, being a
stay-at-home mom, and being a single mom with a full-time job outside the home.
All of them carry their own challenges.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          <u>My</u> mother was always
a stay-at-home mom with five children. Twice she hired a cleaning woman to help
handle the large 6-bedroom, 5-and-a-half bathroom house she and Dad raised us
in; and each time it lasted just a few months before Dad decided we couldn’t
afford the cleaning woman. So Mom would go back to doing all of the cleaning,
laundry, and cooking, while raising five children pretty much on her own – and
in her spare time, taking on leadership roles at our church and in the Diocese,
and walking the neighborhood collecting “Dollars for Democrats!” She was
actually <i>not</i> a “stay-at-home” mom; she just wasn’t <i>paid</i> for all
her work outside the home! She was – like many of our young mothers here –
pretty amazing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Yet when I think back on how
my siblings and I <i>treated </i>her, I’m reminded of all the jokes we made
about her – all the ways in which we didn’t take her seriously. It wasn’t just
affectionate jokes or pranks we did – those she usually appreciated for their
cleverness and humor. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>No; it was
jokes we made – usually behind her back, but sometimes in her presence – that
were an undermining of her strength, intelligence and wisdom that we just
didn’t seem to <u>get</u>. And for that I feel sorry. It doesn’t seem much
different from the jokes I hear from comics on the radio and elsewhere about
their mothers and their mothers-in-law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          And so, on this Mother’s
Day, I wish I could turn some of those jokes into thank-yous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Like the laughing my
siblings and I did when we learned she’d been appointed to the Human Sexuality
Commission of the Episcopal Diocese, to explore the ordination of gay and
lesbian aspirants to the priesthood. I remember us saying to one another in
disbelief, “They’ve asked <u>Mom</u> to be on the sexuality commission?! Don’t
they know how <i>naïve</i> she is – how many jokes about sex she doesn’t <u>get</u>?!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          But she was the perfect
person for that Commission, because she came to it with a humility – and yes,
even a naiveté – that kept her open to new ideas and new relationships, even
when they made her uncomfortable.      She learned everything she could, and
became a strong supporter of civil rights for bisexual, gay, lesbian and
transgender people. Almost until the day she died at age 94, she could be heard
arguing these rights with other residents of the nursing home; it was
inspiring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>The fact that
the Episcopal church has many gay and lesbian priests now, at least a couple of
gay Bishops, and transgender deacons, is in thanks to my mother and the few
others courageous enough back then to take those steps. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>I would want
to say “thank you” to her for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Or all those times I rolled
my eyes as my mom lectured me and my friends about the need for honesty. “Oh
what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive,” she would
recite; and I would cringe and think to myself, “Oh my God, she’s not going to
start with <u>that</u> again, is she?!” I’d look at my friends and roll my eyes
with a smirk, just so they’d know I was properly embarrassed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          But in fact, honesty has
become one of my deepest values; I’ve taught it to my children, and now to
theirs as well. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And when I look back on my life to see
where I got that insistence for honesty, it is only my mother to whom I can
point. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And so I would
want to tell her “thank you” for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I wish my sibs and I hadn’t
laughed after one of her birthday parties, when Dad had proudly presented a
cake with the peace symbol on it, and Mom and her friends had yelled, “Yay,
Peace!” My siblings and I thought it sounded so silly, or shallow, or
who-knows-what?!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          But we were wrong. Because
Mom was our role model for activism; she was the one who taught us that to be a
Christian meant caring for the poor and oppressed, speaking out for the
voiceless, demanding a safe and peaceful world. Eventually, she would fully
support my moving away from Christianity into the broader faith of Unitarian
Universalism, in large part because she’d come to admire so many UUs who had
worked alongside her in their common endeavors for peace and justice. (She knew
our District Executive, Ken Brown, before <i>I</i> did!) And she co-founded the
Interfaith Peace Ministry in Orange County, which brought together many
different faith communities in their common quest for peace. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>It is because
of my mother that my four siblings and I are so committed to that vision as
well. And so I would want to say “thank you” to her for that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          What is it that <i>you</i> would
thank <i>your</i> mother for? What actions seen once in a negative light, do
you now see as a gift to you – as a “blessing of light in which you now dance?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>There are
numerous other things for which I could thank my mother if I had the chance.
But I also don’t think she ever needed specific “thank-yous” from us, because
she knew deep down how much we kids loved and respected her. She had too much
humility to acknowledge this, but my siblings and I all now know that we “dance
in her light.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          My mother was not perfect;
no one’s mother is. None of us who are mothers really knows how to do it. We
all fail our visions, over and over and over again, of the kind of mother we
had hoped to be. And so ultimately, we must be able to laugh not at worn-out
stereotypes, but at our own foibles – with tenderness, and joy, and amazement;
we must be able to laugh, and to forgive. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          And so, in the words of
Reverend Victoria Weinstein, “On this day…, let us honor all who have mothered
us – who from somewhere in their being have freely and wholeheartedly given
life, and sustenance, and vision to us.”</span></p>
