“For by the grace given to me I say to every one of you not to think more
highly of yourself than you ought to think, but to think with sober

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The first time I saw the animated movie “The Incredibles,”
I was a passenger on a bus loaded with 45 middle school children on their way
to the state math competition in San Antonio, Texas. For those of you
unfamiliar with Texas distances, it’s about a five hour drive between Dallas
and San Antonio. Five hours, with 45 middle schoolers on a bus…. I was there
voluntarily. I was there to chaperone the kids from my daughter’s school while
they spent the weekend exploring San Antonio and competing for trophies. I was
there as a mentor and guide to a group of very smart, very driven and
overly-stressed young people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>These kids are the generation Doug Muder tells us will
demand a different Unitarian Universalism. This is the generation who grew up
with Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the Power Rangers. Although he doesn’t
mention it, this is also the generation that grew up with Harry Potter. Harry
Potter is an orphan like Batman, Spiderman and Superman, but has more in common
with Buffy and the Power Rangers. Harry Potter, like these other superheroes,
has a mentor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Muder writes, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='color:black'>When a
next-generation Batman cartoon (<i>Batman Beyond</i>) was created in 1999, the
advice-giving old man was Bruce Wayne himself. Even Batman was no longer a role
you made up on your own; it had become a legacy to live up to.</span></p>

generation that is now in young adulthood has grown up with an expectation – or
maybe just a hope – that would have been foreign to me as a boy: <i>Somewhere,
someone ought to have a wisdom worth passing on, a legacy worth living up to</i>.
(<i>UU World</i>, Winter 2010, p. 28)</span></p>

</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>According to Muder, his generation, which is also my generation,
rejected the notion of their elders having anything worth passing on. Taking
this one step further, I wonder if our generation set out to become the kind of
elders who <u>would</u> have wisdom worth passing on, a legacy worth living up
to. Hoping <u>I </u>would have wisdom to pass on to my daughter and her
generation, I found myself on a five-hour bus ride with 45 middle-school
children, watching the animated movie “The Incredibles.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>At the beginning of the movie, Mr. Incredible is no longer
so incredible. He’s not so young anymore; the father of three; selling
insurance in the suburbs. He and his wife, the former “Elastigirl” are now
known as Bob and Helen. They have left the exciting, superhero days of their
youth behind. They are trying to be normal…to fit in. The problem is their kids
have superpowers too, so it’s hard for them to <u>not</u> be noticed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The story of “The Incredibles” takes us out of the myth of
the lone superhero trying to figure out how to save Metropolis on their own. It
goes past the myth of the orphaned hero mentored by a wisdom-filled elder. By
the end of the movie it is the family working together who saves the world. The
family, itself, emerges as the hero in this modern myth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The Incredibles are what some would consider a “normal”
family, despite their superpowers. They are a two-parent home. Dad provides for
the family. Mom stays at home with baby Jack-Jack while the older children are
in school. Violet is a sullen teenager. Dash is the mischievous middle child.
Each has a gift, a power that adds to the family’s ability to save the world.
At the very end of the movie we discover that even the baby has a superpower
that contributes to thwarting the villain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Each of us has a gift that contributes to the way our
families function. We carry these gifts with us to other areas of our lives:
our work, our causes, our religious communities. These gifts are the result of
the roles we played in our families of origin. These gifts can be the sources
of our own wisdom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The roles we play in our families can be that of the “good”
one or the “rebel.” Maybe we played the role of the “sick one,” often called
the identified patient or maybe we were the “caretaker,” the “family
therapist,” the “star,” the “comic” or lucky enough to have played the role of
the “favored child.” We can all become better people if we pay attention to how
we have been shaped by the roles we played in our families. Going deeper, we acquire
wisdom when we are aware of how these roles can either limit our capacity for
growth or contribute to the good of the whole. Going deeper, we can go into the
shadow side of the family, move beyond the idealized image of the family and be
grateful for what Thomas Moore calls the “sometimes comforting, sometimes
devastating house of life and memory” (<i>Care of the Soul</i>).</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>The Incredibles are superheroes <u>and</u> they are just like me…and
you, probably. They argue over what exit to take on the freeway, just like my
husband and I do, only they are on their way to save the world. By the time many
of us get through the end of our day of running carpool to school, working at the
office, soccer practice, ballet lessons, cooking dinner, reading bedtime
stories, the list goes on, it can feel like our tasks are even larger than merely
saving the world. These day-to-day family activities are in the realm of the mundane,
but if we see them with an eye for myth and the symbolic, they are the tasks we
must complete on the hero’s journey.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Helen, aka Elastigirl is the mother of the Incredibles family. She is
the classic caretaker; her super power is the ability to stretch herself in all
directions. She is the helpmate, the one willing to sacrifice her past glory
days to be the best mother she can be.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Bob, Mr. Incredible is not so incredible anymore.  He used to be the
“good” one, the hero who always saved the day. The shadow side of his
“goodness” is anger. Working in the boring, rule-bound insurance industry he
finally erupts one day. Unleashing his hidden superpowers he angrily throws his
boss through a wall, several walls actually, he does have superpowers after all.
This gets him fired. As a result, he is drawn back to his superhero life. At
first he thinks he is being drawn back to the solitary superhero life, but soon
learns that he no longer has to be the “good one” alone.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Violet, the sullen teen, is a bit of a rebel. She is afraid of being
worthless and even though on the surface she appears to be rebelling against
her family, she really just wants to please everyone. Dash, the mischievous
middle child, is the comic. He likes getting away with things and pulling pranks.
In the end it takes all of the Incredibles family working together to save the
world from destruction.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>The Incredibles, other cartoons and comic books are here to entertain
us. If we let the stories penetrate to a deeper level of our psyches we can gain
insight into our own hero’s journey. Even those whose families don’t look
exactly like the Incredibles can have fun playing in their world because
underneath all of the entertainment there is a deeper truth: the myth of saving
Metropolis on your own is a dying myth. As this myth dies out in our collective
consciousness it is replaced by stories of superheroes learning from mentors, heroes
working as teams, and the family itself as the hero.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>The generation that grew up with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the Power
Rangers and Harry Potter also grew up with the Incredibles. This is the
generation that according to Doug Muder needs mentors. It is also the
generation that knows its own family can be the hero. This is the generation of
Unitarian Universalists that includes a college student named Zach Wahls.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Zach Wahls was raised by two women. Zach’s Moms were both attending UU
congregations when they met. Their commitment ceremony was held in a UU church.
Now legally married, they raised both their children as Unitarian
Universalists.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Zach’s three minutes of testimony before the Iowa legislature has been
seen by millions across the Internet. When the Iowa Supreme Court struck down a
legislative measure that banned same-sex marriage, conservative groups
mobilized. After the elections in the fall of 2010 three Supreme Court justices
had been voted out of office and the GOP had regained a majority in the Iowa
House. It wasn’t clear if the Democratic majority in the Iowa Senate could
remain strong against the opponents of same-sex marriage.  Republicans in the
Iowa House drafted an amendment to the Iowa Constitution to redefine marriage
as between one man and one woman. The amendment was out of committee and on to
the public hearing phase. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Zach decided to testify. His emotional testimony bears witness to his
character, his UU values and to the women who raised him. His family emerges as
a hero to save the world from sentimental images of what the family should be.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>What the family can be is like my friend Karla and her daughter Larkin.
Karla adopted Larkin four years ago from China and is raising her alone. </span>Karla
and Larkin are only one example of a family that doesn’t look like the
“traditional family.” Or as Karla likes to put it: her journey to her daughter
was a little different than most families.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Our
churches are filled with families whose journeys to their children are a little
different than most families. In one of our UU churches it is customary to give
the role of the baby Jesus in the Christmas play to the most recent baby born
in the congregation. The baby’s parents play Mary and Joseph. Some years the
“actor” portraying the baby Jesus has two mothers. Other years the baby Jesus
has two dads. I can think of a long list of families that don’t fit the
definition of the “traditional family.” Teenaged Jeffrey and his two Dads who
have raised him from infancy. Baby Stephanie who was given to her two Dads
because after being abandoned by her drug addict mother, her grandmother didn’t
feel comfortable raising a bi-racial child in her home. 11-year-old Jamie who
was adopted out of the foster care system by a single father. Two women,
married in Iowa, who raised a boy named Zach. Two women in Iowa, one of whom
was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when Zach was nine years old. For Zach,
his mother’s battle with this disease is the most important task she faces on
her own hero’s journey.  </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>These
are today’s families emerging out of the myths of the past; myths that if we misinterpret
them can make us feel alone for being different. Today’s families are led by
single-parents and same-sex parents. Today’s families are put together with
open adoptions and donor siblings. We are blended and we are multi-racial.  And
we’re all about to spend the holidays together.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>‘Tis the season to be bombarded with images from both popular culture
and religion about the family. Movies like <i>National Lampoon’s Christmas
Vacation</i>, <i>A Christmas Story</i>, <i>Bad Santa</i> and <i>Elf </i>are
reminders of how the dysfunctions of our families rise to the surface in this darkest
of seasons. Scenes from Victorian Christmases show idealized versions of the
holidays with perfectly decorated trees, surrounded by perfect families with
their sumptuous amounts of food and gifts. And of course there is the most
perfect family of all, the holy family.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>The image embedded in all of our psyches, whether we are Christian or
not, is Mary the virgin mother serenely watching over her divine child while
the self-sacrificing step-father Joseph looks on from the sidelines. Taken
literally, this image demands perfection none of us can live up to. Taken
literally, this image shuts out all the families that don’t look like this one.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Lived symbolically this myth takes us into the expectation of something
new waiting to shine forth from the darkness. Lived symbolically this story can
teach us that divine mystery is always waiting to be born. Even in the midst of
our rebellions against parents and elders who cannot possibly tell us how to
live. Even in the midst of our struggles to become the parents and mentors we’d
hoped we’d had, wisdom is waiting to be born. Even in the midst of voices
telling us our family isn’t the right kind of family, heroes rise up. Old myths
offer up new lessons. Hope is born again.</span></p>
