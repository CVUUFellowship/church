<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span>Last
Sunday driving home after a long day, a long week and quite frankly, a rather
long and dark year I saw Santa skateboarding down a street in my neighborhood.
I’ve seen Santa before. He gets around this time of year, showing up in various
locations prior to his big night out. I’ve never seen this particular Santa
before. Dressed in shorts and wearing sunglasses, he was holding a long pole with
a camera attached, holding it out in front of himself and filming his
skateboarding descent down the sloping entryway into my neighborhood. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I imagine he was getting the mountains as his
background. He paused and started over every time a car entered the shot. I
tried to pause long enough to capture his videotaping efforts on my camera
phone, but gave up after he stopped multiple times. Here’s this year’s deep
symbol for the season: my failure to capture Santa’s failure to skateboard down
a Southern California street with mountains and clouds in the distance. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It was not one of our classic sunny days. Storms had
been forecast for the coming week. Violent downpours and mudslides were in our
future. The darkness of the season was coming. In the meanwhile, the
sunglasses, short bedecked Santa was determined to capture the perfect moment.
I wonder if he ever got it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We all try to capture the perfect moment during the
holidays, don’t we? Or, maybe we are tempted to skip the holidays altogether
because the pressure to create perfect moments is just too much. My minister,
the Rev. Dr. Laurel Hallman, preached that, “The first Sunday in December is
often the cusp, just before we begin the long mad slide into
Christmas/Hanukkah/Solstice/Kwanzaa. The cusp where many of us resolve to not
‘do’ Christmas this year.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This year Thanksgiving was late, so Advent came
early on November 30<sup>th</sup>. Because I was raised an Episcopalian
Christian, I still observe Advent but more in my mind these days than by
putting out the calendar I bought when my children were little. It remains in a
box in storage, with most of my ornaments. I have a three-foot fake tree that I
try to protect from our two cats. This year it has only four ornaments on it –
because of the cats.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Each year I resolve to do less of Christmas,
choosing instead to wrestle with the theology so that I can “do” Christmas as a
minister. This year I thought I’d start with mystery and wonder, writing this
description of today’s sermon for the newsletter: “The gift of this time of
year is to be reminded to gaze at our lives through the eyes of a child. We are
reminded of mystery and wonder and the potential for joy in the smallest
moments. Remaining open, we allow ourselves to be immersed in the darkness of
the shortest days of the year and with faith we wait for the light to
reappear.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Mystery and wonder…that darling duo that’s supposed
to be present for us as we bake the cookies, buy the presents and sing the
carols. Mystery and wonder – possibility and awe. I have been waiting for
mystery and wonder (possibility and awe) to show up, but all I know on this
third Sunday in Advent is what my minister taught me: “It’s not dark because
it’s Christmas; it’s Christmas because it’s dark.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I’m just not ready for Christmas, not ready for the
mystery and wonder part, the part where I gaze at my life as if I am gazing
through the eyes of a child. Not ready for the birth of hope. I refuse to enjoy
the absurdity of a skateboarding Santa – refusing to see the potential for joy
in the smallest of moments. I’m not ready to sing along with the carols on the
radio yet. “It’s not dark because it’s Christmas; it’s Christmas because it’s
dark,” I stubbornly intone. Besides, it’s not Christmas yet anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It’s Advent and rather than engage with Fox News’
trumped up “War on Christmas,” I’m with the pundits and theologians who are
warning us that the “real” war of this dark season is the one being waged on
Advent.  Christmas, the way my family always celebrated it, is traditionally
Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and the twelve days that come after. It’s not the
shopping season that leads up to it – the eleven more shopping days we now have
left – when we get to decide if we say “happy holidays” or “Merry Christmas” to
the harried department store employee. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“Does FOX News want us all to say ‘Merry Christmas’
so we forget about Advent?” writes theologian Diana Butler Bass. “These, after
all, are the four weeks that the Christian tradition dedicates to God's vision
of justice for the outcast and oppressed, not to celebrating the sound of
ringing cash registers or Victorian America values.” Perhaps FOX News is a bit
nervous, she suggests, reluctant to come out in favor of Advent over Christmas
because the true tradition of this time period is to prepare a place for one of
lowly birth who proclaims good news to the poor and the oppressed.  (<a

</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is not time to say “Merry Christmas” yet. We have
not lived through the longest night of the year yet. The sun has not returned
as bright as a new-born babe yet. It is not time for mystery and wonder…yet. It
is time to acknowledge the darkness of the season, whether it comes from the
current political situation or whether it comes from a personal darkness that
seems to settle over us out of some deep ancient knowing. Laurel Hallman also
taught me that, “this season is a season in which we are called to face the
darkness head-on, and sing anyway.”</p>

</span></span>This week a Senate Committee released their findings about the
use of torture to interrogate terror suspects after the attacks of September 11<sup>th</sup>.
The report is controversial, of course, and some would argue that the tactics
used didn’t amount to torture and that it is necessary to use such tactics to
extract information and protect our country. We listen to the arguments on both
sides as we await the birth of hope.</p>

</span></span>Today marks the second anniversary of the Sandy Hook massacre
that killed twenty children and six teachers on December 14, 2012. Since the shooting
in Newtown, CT, there have been at least 94 school shootings in America — an
average of nearly one a week. We mourn the tragic loss as we acknowledge the
ancient wisdom in the symbol of light shining in the darkness, and the darkness
does not overcome it.</p>

</span></span>Thousands of protesters walked down Pennsylvania Avenue in
Washington D.C. yesterday to march alongside the families of African-Americans
killed in recent months by law enforcement officers. The families of Michael Brown,
Eric Garner and Tamir Rice were among those at the &quot;Justice for All&quot;
march, where protesters carried signs reading &quot;Black Lives Matter.&quot; Thousands
more marched in protests in major US cities. We prayed today in solidarity with
black churches throughout this country, praying for the safety of young black
men and an end to the systemic violence against them. We face the darkness
head-on and we pray, we sing, we march. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Two years ago I received a phone call from a
reporter asking if I would be addressing the Connecticut tragedy in my
Christmas message. The reporter was interviewing local clergy and, having grown
up a Unitarian Universalist, she was eager to include our approach to the
tragedy during what is supposed to be “a joyful time of year.” She was aware
that most clergy had immediately addressed the mass shooting at Sandy Hook
Elementary the Sunday right after it had occurred. What she wanted to know was
would we continue to address the tragedy at a time of year when people are
“supposed to be happy?” (her words)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I reminded her that Unitarian Universalists always
worship within the context of how the world is now. I assured her that even
without specifically referring to the Connecticut tragedy that it would be on
our minds as we looked to this time of year not as a time when we are “supposed
to be happy,” but as a time that we acknowledge the ancient wisdom in the
symbol of light shining in the darkness, and the darkness does not overcome it.
This is the time of year when the world turns from the darkness of the longest
night to more light in the lengthening of each day. This turning from darkness
to light, and back again, each year is not a choice. It is the way things are.
If you find yourself despairing more than usual from one year to the next, you
have resources. You have each other. You have me, your minister. And you have a
theology that allows you to despair until hope arrives at last in the natural
course of the way things are.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Wendell Berry’s words have risen out of my
consciousness this last dark week like a mantra:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>When
despair for the world grows in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in
fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be, I go and lie down where
the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>I
come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with fore-thought
of grief. I come into the presence of still water. And I feel above me the
day-blind stars waiting with their light. For a time I rest in the grace of the
world, and am free.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>I tried forcing myself into
mystery and wonder, possibility and awe, but it was too soon. Despair for the
world and for my children’s lives grows in me like an evil twin to the holy
child of hope. But this isn’t the right analogy; I know that despair isn’t
evil. I know that if I wait with my despair, it will be born alongside the
child of hope and it will teach me as much wisdom as hope does. Maybe more.
Finally at home in the grace of the world, I am content to wait for mystery and
wonder to arrive in its own time. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Christmas will come amidst the shootings and the
cancer and the recovery and the relapse. Christmas will come as the earth turns
towards more light. In time, we can allow ourselves to be immersed in the
darkness of the longest nights of the year as with faith we wait for the light
to reappear.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I mentioned that I’ve seen Santa before, so I
thought I’d better clarify what I meant by that. When I say that I’ve seen
Santa Claus before, I mean that I’ve seen THE Santa – the real one, one with a
PhD in Santahood. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For the past twenty five years or so, the real Santa
has visited a mall in Dallas. There are always very long lines to meet Santa
because, of course, he is the real one. One year I waited with my girls most of
the morning and finally we were getting very excited because our number was
next. And then Santa went on his lunch break. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>So we took a lunch break, too. On our way back from
lunch we stepped onto the escalator to go back downstairs to Santa’s village
and then Santa got on the escalator right behind us. The girls’ eyes grew as
large as sugar plums, or some other fantastical Christmas food. They were
overcome with excitement. It was quite mysterious and even wonderful how we
rode the escalator with Santa that day and walked together with him to our
appointment with joy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Christmas will come as the earth turns towards more
light. In time, we can allow ourselves to be immersed in the darkness of the
longest nights of the year as with faith we wait for the light to reappear. </p>
