boundaries is hard work. It is not work we usually seek out willingly. If we
are lucky enough it is work that comes to us when we are busy building walls.
If we are lucky enough it comes to us as a sort of grace, a gift we never
expected to receive. It comes to us in the form of the stranger, a neighbor we
meet for the first time. It comes to us when we start a new job or a class and
we sit next to someone whose life experience is far different from our own. It
comes to us when we have the courage to take ourselves out of our comfortable
lives and enter into the new.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Aneta
Brodski is a deaf teen living in the Queens section of New York City. She
becomes an American Sign Language poet who breaks barriers when she enters a
spoken word slam contest.  Aneta, who immigrated to America from Israel with
her parents when she was seven, meets Tahani, a hearing Palestinian slam poet.
They collaborate, each entering into the other’s world as far as they can, and
create a new art form – a shared poem that transcends the many boundaries that
separate them. This is the story the film “Deaf Jam” tells. “Deaf Jam” will be
shown tonight as a part of our new Community Cinema Film Series. This is not a
commercial, it is a reflection. It is a reflection on how the programs of our
church call us to action. It is a reflection on how the programs of this
community define who we are, prompting us to grow and change. This reflection
could easily be on how forty of us gathered yesterday at the corner of Lynn and
Hillcrest roads to help launch “Occupy Thousand Oaks” or it could be a
reflection on the many one-on-one meetings I’ve been having as I get to know
you. Those reflections will come later, I promise. Today I’m reflecting on
entering into a silent world where the language that makes us human isn’t
voiced but is embodied.  I have entered this silent world before and I must
tell you it can be very loud.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I
spent the night once at the Texas School for the Deaf in Austin. Waking up to
slamming doors and thundering feet in the corridors, my first impression was
“it’s really loud here.” I briefly met some of the kids the night before, when
my sister – the house mother for this noisy group of teens – introduced them to
me and then she left for a much-needed weekend break. My sister was letting me
stay in her room while I visited friends in Austin. I was gone for most of the
weekend I stayed in the dormitory at the Texas School for the Deaf. It was a
good thing that I wasn’t there much. Without my sister there to help me, I was
unable to communicate with anyone. As I quickly gathered my things Saturday
morning to leave, wanting to avoid the awkwardness of smiling at strangers I
could not communicate with, I realized why it was so loud there. They could not
hear their own noise. They could not hear the sound of their own footsteps
running down the hallway to get the best seat for breakfast.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When
my sister first lost her hearing, she could no longer hear the sound of her own
footsteps. She was nine and had meningitis. They didn’t fit her with a hearing
aid right away. Eventually she would adjust to the disorientation of not only
the loss of most of her hearing, but also her ability to balance. When she
finally got her hearing aids – for both ears – she was taught to lip read. She
was not taught to sign. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>From
1880 to 1960, American Sign Language was suppressed in the schools and went
underground, until statistics showed that the suppression of sign language was
detrimental to learning for the Deaf. In 1964, the year my sister lost the
majority of her hearing, the U.S. Congress issued the Babbidge report, stating
that “oralism” was a dismal failure. For decades, the main controversy in
educating the Deaf revolved around oralism vs. manualism—whether it was better
to teach children sign language or to make them learn to speak orally, in order
to fit into mainstream society. After being banned for more than eighty years,
sign language was allowed back into schools in the 1960s.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>My
sister Beth isn’t deaf, she is hearing impaired or hard of hearing, the ADA
official label. Beth retained the use of the spoken language she had developed
through the age of nine. Still, she was affected by the Deaf world and
decisions made that defined it. Partly in the Deaf world and partly in the
hearing world, my sister has been crossing borders since she was nine years
old. Transcending boundaries is hard work.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Transcending
boundaries is such hard work because we would like to destroy the walls we
build to separate us from “the other” by making “them” more like “us”. We,
humankind, have done this before. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Papal
Bulls of the 15th century gave Christian explorers the right to claim lands
they &quot;discovered&quot; and lay claim to those lands for their Christian
Monarchs. Any land that was not inhabited by Christians was available to be
&quot;discovered&quot;, claimed, and exploited. If the &quot;pagan&quot;
inhabitants could be converted, they might be spared. If not, they could be
enslaved or killed. The indigenous population, “them” would be made to be more
like “us” by conversion. Children were taken away from parents and sent to
schools that would make them more like “us.” They were forced to worship, speak
and dress like “us.”</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This
is the Discovery Doctrine and it is a concept of public international law first
defined in a series of decisions by the United States Supreme Court in the late
19<sup>th</sup> Century. The doctrine has been primarily used to support
decisions invalidating or ignoring aboriginal possession of land in favor of
colonial or post-colonial governments. It is a Doctrine that still governs United
States Indian Law today and has been cited as recently as 2005. It is more than
just a doctrine that supports decisions under the law; it is a worldview that
draws boundaries around a supposedly superior “us” so that the supposedly
inferior “them” cannot enter in. If we let you into our exclusive, better way
of life you must give up who you are. Give up your claim to the land. Give up
your way of life. Give up your language in order to be like us. You must leave
your silent world and come into our better, hearing world in order to be more
like us.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Cochlear
implants are surgically implanted devices that provide electrical stimulation that
is similar to what occurs in the ear of a hearing person. Because the primary
language-learning years are 0-3 years of age, many have argued that it is
unethical to implant a deaf child older than three because the chances of
success after the age of three are greatly diminished. Many have also argued
that it is unethical to implant any deaf child and take away a trait they are
born with. Members of the Deaf community see their deafness as a trait rather
than a disability and resist any attempt to label deafness as a medical
condition. They are a separate culture where “deafness” is the norm. Removing a
child from this culture, giving them the ability to hear, is the same as
removing indigenous children from their culture and sending them to boarding
school to learn the dominant culture’s way of life. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Still
others argue that a deaf child born to hearing parents isn’t acculturated to
Deaf culture until they are sent to Deaf schools, deaf churches or deaf social
organizations. The Deaf community disagrees: a child born deaf, even to hearing
parents, is born into the deaf community; their birthright is a culture of
silence.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In
his poem, “Listening,” UU minister Jacob Trapp wrote: “To learn the true power
of words is to learn also the power of silence.” His words take on greater
meaning when heard in the context of American Sign Language poetry. Trapp’s
poem begins, “If it is language that makes us human; one half of language is to
listen.” A deaf person cannot listen. “Silence can exist without speech, but
speech cannot exist without silence.” A deaf person’s silence is all encompassing.
Their language is the language of gesture, facial expression and imagery.
Silence speaks from silence into silence.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Jacob
Trapp’s poem “Listening” is a poem that can be written down and read in a book.
The sort of poetry Aneta Brodski creates is performed in a language that cannot
exist in a book. It is fleeting, ephemeral, of the body. When Aneta, a deaf
Israeli Jew, meets Tahani, a hearing Palestinian Muslim, two languages meet,
two cultures meet and in the end there is only one poem. “Sometimes in my
dreams I am signing and everybody understands me,” Aneta tells the film maker.
Transcending boundaries is hard work.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>My
sister finally learned American Sign Language when she was in college. She
dated a deaf man for a short time and determined that, having been born
hearing, she could never completely belong to that world. She doesn’t quite
belong to the hearing world either but she crosses its borders daily when she
wakes each morning and puts on her hearing aids. We help her. Her kids help
her. We all know when she hasn’t heard what’s been going on around her and we
get her attention, look her directly in the face so she can read our lips and
listen at the same time. We know when she hasn’t heard the waitress in a loud
restaurant. We’ve learned over the years how to briefly build a bridge into her
world and bring her along into ours. I was five when my sister had meningitis
and lost most of her hearing. I can remember standing helpless at bus stops and
in school playgrounds while ignorant kids made fun of her. She was the “other”
and I was her sister and I had not yet learned how to transcend the boundary
that had been arbitrarily drawn between us.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Yvonne
Seon acknowledges that transcending boundaries is hard work. “For one thing,
I’ve created more of them since I was young, and I’ve built them higher and
stronger than they once were,” she writes. Self-righteousness, fear, ignorance,
and anger all build strong, high walls.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We
start out without boundaries, being one with our mother’s body. Being born
starts a lifelong journey towards self-differentiation. At first we imitate our
parents as we learn what it means to be part of a distinct group, a family.
Then we reject everything our parents stand for and strike out with our own
identities. The ability to define boundaries is first learned in families.
Families with very strict and rigid boundaries declare their way of doing
family is the only way. Families with loose boundaries never quite define who
they are in relation to the rest of the world – anything goes, and anything can
come and go as it pleases. Those families who fall in the middle, the ones with
porous boundaries engender trust and a sense of self in their children. Encountering
others, families or governments or religions can react with arrogance, fear or ignorance.
Or families, governments and religious can respond with acceptance, curiosity
and trust. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN-GB>There is a village called Neve Shalom/Wahat al-Salam, also known as
Oasis of Peace. The name itself transcends boundaries because the residents of
this village are 50% Jewish and 50% Palestinian, all with Israeli citizenship.
“The village began in 1978 when the first family joined Father Bruno Hussar who
had been living on the land for six years. Father Hussar was born a Jew in
Egypt and later converted to Catholicism. He has dedicated much of his life to
establishing peace between Arabs and Jews. …. ‘For years there have been
academies in the various countries where the art of war has been taught’,
Father Hussar wrote. ‘(W)e wanted to found a school for peace, for peace, too,
is an art...’” (<a href="http://nswas.org/">http://nswas.org/</a>) Two languages,
two cultures, one village transcending boundaries of fear and isolation.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Transcending
boundaries is hard work. It is not work we usually seek out willingly. If we
are lucky enough it is work that comes to us when we are busy building walls.
