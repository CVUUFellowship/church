<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><b>©
Rev. Lora Brandis</b></p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><b><span

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
parable of the Good Samaritan is told by Jesus after he is asked the question,
“Who is my neighbor?” The expert in the law who attempts to test Jesus is
forced to admit that his sworn enemy, the Samaritan, is the only true neighbor
in the story because of his merciful actions. The questioner doesn’t ask, “Who
is my enemy?” We don’t like to ask that question of ourselves. We’re afraid the
answer might be too much like the one offered in the Parable of the Good
Samaritan – our enemy is our neighbor. If we are to love our neighbors as we
love ourselves and our enemy is our neighbor, well then the logic leads to the
cognitive dissonance of loving our enemies.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We
like to think we have no sworn enemies. We are a loving, religious people; we
don’t have any enemies. Even as our government renews it’s involvement in Iraq,
we do not collectively rise up and name the country of Iraq as our enemy. Even
as we mourn the loss of life from the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17
over war-torn Ukraine, we do not name the country of Russia as our enemy. Even
as war rages in Gaza, we hold back in naming an enemy in fear of adding more
hate into an already hate-filled argument.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As
the Holly Near song goes, “We are a gentle, angry people.” We are also a “gentle,
loving people,” according to the song. Our enemies are the faceless entities we
name as injustice, hatred and war. Psychologist Rick Hanson warns against what
happens when we name hatred as an enemy. He warns that when we name hatred as
an enemy we turn it into just one more “other,” one more object that is outside
of our circle. We create a category that excludes and separates the whole into
“us” and “them.” </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“We
don’t hate, but they do,” we naively think. “Like it or not,” Hanson writes, “the
wolf of hate is alive and well inside each one of us. It’s easy to hear about a
dreadful murder across the country or terrorism and torture across the world –
or milder forms of everyday mistreatment of others close at hand – and shake
your head, thinking, ‘What’s wrong with them?’ But them is actually us….” (<i>Buddha’s
Brain</i>, p. 132) We are both angry and loving, just like our enemies, just
like everybody else.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
poet Sam Keen instructs us on “how to create an enemy”: “Trace onto the face of
the enemy the greed, hatred, carelessness you dare not claim as your own,” he
writes. The psalmist wrote, “You prepare a table before me in the presence of
my enemies,” implying that Love is present even in the midst of our enemies. Modern
translations acknowledge the root of the ancient word for enemy in updated
versions of the 23<sup>rd</sup> Psalm that substitute the word enemy with the
words injustice, fear or pain. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Who
is my enemy? Injustice, fear, pain, complacency, despair…there are many. I have
many enemies and so do you. Name some of your enemies into this sacred space
and claim them as your own. (Pause)</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Last
week I was arrested for civil disobedience in Washington DC. More than 100 faith
leaders and immigrant activists were arrested with me as we called on President
Obama to stop deportations immediately and to care for children at the border. It
was the largest ever civil disobedience at the White House for immigrant
justice. During the action I stood next to Antonio, a man from El Salvador. The
risk I took was small compared to Antonio’s. As an undocumented aspiring
American married to an American citizen and raising two American citizen
children, Antonio’s participation was more courageous than mine. Luckily, the
entire arrest and charge had been negotiated beforehand. We were all let go
after paying a fine of only $50. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>While
we stood blocking passage – refusing to move after three warnings by the park
police – we sang “We Shall Not Be Moved” and “We are Marching in the Light of
God.” We chanted, “Not One More” and “Ni Una Mas.” Antonio and I chatted. He
asked me if I had ever been arrested before. I told him I had not. We laughed.
He hadn’t been arrested before either. Having served as a policeman in his
country of origin, this would be a new experience for him too. He thanked me
over and over again, saying, “You don’t have to be here. This isn’t your fight.
Please know how grateful we are that people like you are standing with us. It’s
so good to know we are not alone.” </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
day after I was arrested the House of Representatives passed bills that fuel
the already hate-filled rhetoric of the immigration reform “us versus them” debate
in this country. We say, “Stop deporting kids, moms, dads, workers, and members
of our community.” They say, “No work permits for illegal aliens when 18
million Americans cannot find a full time job.” We say, “Granting work permits
as part of deferred action is a critical step towards creating policies of dignity
for working immigrants.” They say, “Support policies that discourage illegal
immigration.” We say, “We cannot allow thousands of refugee children to be put
at risk of exploitation, trafficking, rape and even death.” They say, “We
oppose housing of illegal border-crossers on the taxpayer's dime.” </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I
went to Washington DC to be arrested for civil disobedience in order to
confront my enemy. My enemy is not Congress or the President or the people who
disagree with me. My enemy is silence. My enemy is remaining silent while the
laws of our broken immigration system continue to create enemies out of men,
women and children painted with a face of greed, hatred, and carelessness this
nation dares not claim as its own. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I
didn’t go to Washington DC just to be arrested. I went to attend the “Pray for
Relief—Not One More Family Separated Summit” which included worshipping with
Unitarian Universalists at the Universalist National Memorial Church, attending
trainings with 70 interfaith leaders from around the nation and marching behind
the “standing on the side of love” banner in the “Not One More” protest last
Saturday morning. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>About
50 UUs marched alongside undocumented people carrying the banners of Not One
More Deportation and Deferred Action for All. Those two banners were raised by
pole climbers at Freedom Plaza in a bolder and riskier act of civil
disobedience than the one I participated in Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We
gathered Saturday morning across the street from the Smithsonian. The march
took us past the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building to Freedom Plaza
where we watched the pole climbers hang the banners and be removed from the
poles by the fire department and then get led away by the police. We moved
towards the White House responding to chant leaders with megaphones placed
strategically throughout the line. For most of the march we chanted separately,
the back of the line not knowing what the front of the line was shouting.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There
was one moment, right before we got to Freedom Plaza, when we paused together
in the street and the chant became the same for the entire line: “Not one
more!” I could hear that we were all together on this one. I could feel the
sense of being one body, chanting together. As a person of faith and a minister
I talk a lot about being one with all of life. It is an intellectual concept
that I rarely feel directly. As I chanted with more than 1,200 others on the
streets of Washington I felt it – that sense of being one with all of life –
that unitive, transcendent experience that most religious traditions describe. And
I was angry.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
Cherokee tale about the two wolves is told to teach children to come from love
rather than from hate. There are two wolves fighting inside of us, the story
goes. “Who wins?” the child asks the wise elder. “The one I feed each day,”
teaches the old Cherokee. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Many
have asked me why I allowed myself to be arrested and why I stand on the side
of love on this divisive issue. I sometimes answer that I advocate for
immigration reform because of my Cuban-American husband’s experience as a
refugee. I sometimes answer the question by telling the story of observing
abject poverty in Honduras when as a teenager I served as a volunteer for
Amigos de las Americas vaccinating children against TB. I also answer that my
Unitarian Universalist faith tradition calls me to prophetic witness. I stand
with our interfaith partners when we say that we are held to a higher calling
where we put the law to love our neighbor above and beyond any unjust human
law. I have never said that I advocate for comprehensive and compassionate
immigration reform because I’m angry. Yet, there I was wearing my standing on
the side of love t-shirt with my clergy collar feeling a deep-seated, primal
anger at the same time I was feeling one with all of life – not the usual,
unitive experience described by the mystics.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There
is an anger that fuels our justice work. If we are honest with ourselves, we
will see our own anger in the face of our supposed enemy and we will feel
compassion. The anger I felt last week was anger at the human condition, it was
anger at a world that allows war to go on forever and children to die
violently. Who is my enemy? My enemy is arrogance. It is arrogant to believe
that my anger is any different from the hate that is spewed by the “other
side.” Yes, we stand on the side of love but don’t fool yourself into believing
that we are better than those we say are standing on the side of hate. Rick Hanson
says that “Being realistic and honest about the wolf of hate – and its impersonal,
evolutionary origins – brings self-compassion.” Being realistic and honest
about our anger being the same as our enemy’s anger brings compassion for all.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Although
we had been on our feet for five hours three of us kept walking. We wanted to
see the Lincoln Memorial and the King Memorial before we left Washington.
Standing before the Inscription Wall we read these words by Dr. King: 
&quot;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an
inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever
affects one directly, affects all indirectly.&quot; Who is my enemy? My enemy,
my neighbor, and myself are one and the same. All of us are deserving of
compassion. All of us.</p>
