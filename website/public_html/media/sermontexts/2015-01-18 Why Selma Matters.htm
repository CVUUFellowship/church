<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are three references to Unitarian
Universalists in the movie “Selma.” I went expecting two and was surprised by
the third and last one, the final note in a movie that celebrates a tipping
point in the Civil Rights Movement fifty years ago just as it inspires today’s
#BlackLivesMatter Movement. In his book <i>The Selma Awakening: How the Civil
Rights Movement Tested and Changed Unitarian Universalism</i>, the Rev. Dr.
Mark Morrison-Reed writes, “Selma was the tipping point. The injustice was so
obvious, and the righteousness of the cause so evident, that for some an inner
moral calculus instantly provided an answer.” Fifty years ago, Unitarian Universalists
were challenged to answer Dr. King's call and show up in Selma. Many did; two
died. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As the fiftieth anniversary of the march from Selma
to Montgomery approaches, Unitarian Universalists are being asked to answer a
different challenge. What do the events of fifty years ago mean to us today
when the streets of our country are filled with people holding signs
proclaiming &quot;black lives matter?&quot; What does it mean to be a Unitarian
Universalist now? Our association’s president Rev. Peter Morales challenges us
to “feel our past live in us.” How do we do that? How do we understand why
Selma matters?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are obvious actions we can take: 1. See the
movie. 2. Read Morrison-Reed’s book. 3. The conference honoring the 50th
Anniversary of the Selma Voting Rights Campaign is full, but you can still
register for the one-day-only event of the Sunday March 8<sup>th</sup> trip
from Birmingham to Selma for the historic march re-enactment. 4. Learn our
history as Americans and as Unitarian Universalists and teach it to our children.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We all love to play the game “I remember what I was
doing when…” We remember what we were doing and where we were when the planes
flew into the World Trade Center Towers on September 11, 2001. We remember
where we were when home-grown terrorists ignited bombs in Oklahoma City, when
the ATF raided the Branch Davidians’ ranch in Waco, when Robert Kennedy was
assassinated, Martin Luther King Jr’s assassination and when President Kennedy
was killed. We remember what we were doing, where we were and who we were and
how those events shaped our lives. As we continue to more deeply identify as
Unitarian Universalists it is important to understand what our faith movement
was doing, where it was and how it viewed itself as a religion during formative
historic events. It is one thing to study a timeline of our history beginning
with early Christian heresies moving through to humanism and beyond in order to
understand who we are as Unitarian Universalists. It is quite another thing to
“feel our past live in us.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In this congregation our past is part the Unitarian
fellowship movement that began in the 1940s and continued through the 1960s.
Founded in 1961, the same year the Unitarians and the Universalists came
together to form our new religion, this congregation’s history and its present
circumstance are bound by location and demographics. While some in fellowships
were engaging in social action opposing racial discrimination before Selma, the
suburban location of many of our congregations during that time isolated us
from the people we were most trying to support. Not only was the location of
these newer congregations isolating, but the fellowship culture was also
off-putting to many African Americans. According to Mark Morrison-Reed, four
characteristics of the typical fellowship culture conflicted with
African-American sensibilities: “resistance to growth, ‘flat-earth humanism,’ a
particular style of worship, and resistance to authority” (loc 1044). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Unitarian Universalists have always been resistant
to proselytizing; reaching out specifically to racial minorities in the 1960s
would have been counter to many of our congregations’ need to stay small and feel
like an extended family. The “flat-earth humanism” that dominated our
denomination during that time resulted in a rigid theology that rejected
Christianity completely. This theology and attitude was not attractive to
African Americans, especially when the theology and the language of
Christianity were uniting them in their struggle. Fellowships encouraged
informality and a casual atmosphere for worship. The tradition in the black
church was to treat Sunday as an opportunity to dress up, an opportunity many
blacks didn’t have in their work lives as the servant class to most of America.
Unitarian Universalism’s resistance to authority was also foreign to African
Americans who held their clergy in high esteem and looked to the larger body of
worshipping black Christians as a source of their identity. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“What, then, did Unitarian Universalism have to
offer to African Americans?” Mark Morrison-Reed asks. “More often than not,
those who ventured into a UU fellowship found an intellectual club struggling
with an ambivalent relationship to worship.” The response of Unitarian
Universalism to race in America was very much the same response as many other affluent
progressive whites in America. Yes, there were progressive voices in our
movement and, at the same time, our professed liberal values were not often
matched by our practices. Selma was a test. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. sent a telegram
on March 8, 1965 that read in part, “The people of Selma will struggle on for
the soul of the nation, but it is fitting that all America help to bear the
burden. I call therefore, on clergy of all faiths representative of every part
of this country, to join me for a ministers’ march to Montgomery…. In this way
all America will testify to the fact that the struggle in Selma is for the
survival of democracy everywhere in our land” (<i>UU World</i>, Winter 2014). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Fifty years ago hundreds of Unitarian Universalists
answered King’s call. Two died. America was changed by the events in Selma.
Unitarian Universalism was changed by the events in Selma, too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Rev. James Reeb was working for the American
Friends Service Committee in Boston on a housing program focused on
desegregation when he received the call from our association’s headquarters
about King’s request for clergy to join him in Selma. Reeb had been active in
the civil rights movement since the 1950s, he had left parish ministry to live
and work in the African-American community; it seemed an obvious choice for him
to make. He and his wife had participated together in the March on Washington
in 1963. But they had also watched together on national television the night
before when the march from Selma had been stopped abruptly at the foot of the
Edmund Pettus Bridge. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In what would become known as Bloody Sunday, state
troopers and local law enforcement brutally beat and tear-gassed six hundred
peaceful African-American marchers. The Reebs had four children, including an
infant. Reeb’s wife Marie didn’t want him to go, but he insisted and she finally
relented.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>By Tuesday afternoon there were about forty-five UU
ministers and fifteen laypeople in Selma waiting. The White House requested
that the march be delayed and an injunction against it had been issued by the
district federal judge. At 3pm 2,500 marchers led by King went back to the
Pettus Bridge. Faced with five hundred Alabama state troopers the marchers
knelt and prayed, the troopers parted as if to let them pass but King rose and
led the marchers back to Brown Chapel AME. Fearing there would be more
violence, they would wait until the injunction was lifted. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Tuesday evening a group of UU ministers headed to
dinner at a restaurant recommended to them by the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference headquarters. After dinner, the Rev. Orloff Miller, director of the
Unitarian Universalist Association’s Office of College Centers, Rev. James Reeb
and the Rev. Clark Olsen, minister of the Berkeley Fellowship walked together
towards Brown Chapel. Four or five white locals came out of a store behind them
and started yelling. Olsen and Miller heard what was possibly a bat or a length
of pipe hit James Reeb’s head. All three were beaten. Two days later James Reeb
died. President Johnson called Marie to offer his condolences. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>On Monday, March 15<sup>th</sup> about 109 UU
ministers gathered in Selma to hear King memorialize Reeb. Later that evening
President Johnson addressed a joint session of Congress, introducing the Voting
Rights Bill with these famous words repeated in the movie <i>Selma</i> and by
Mark Morrison-Reed in his account of the events: “At times history and fate
meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man’s
unending search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a
century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama. There, long
suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as
Americans. Many were brutally assaulted, one good man of God, was killed.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Johnson didn’t mention African-American Jimmie Lee
Jackson, whose death had inspired the marches. Weeks before Reeb’s death, while
participating in a peaceful voting rights march in Marion, Alabama Jimmie Lee
Jackson was beaten and shot in the stomach by an Alabama state trooper. Jackson
had tried to protect his mother and grandfather when a trooper began beating them.
Jackson, a twenty-six-year-old Army veteran, died several days later of a
massive infection. The idea for a march to Montgomery taking the fight for
voting rights directly to Alabama’s governor George Wallace was a response to
Jackson’s tragic death.</p>

</span>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Finally, the injunction was lifted and on Sunday
March 21<sup>st</sup>, Martin and Coretta King led about 3,200 towards Montgomery.
On the final day of the march, more than 30,000 assembled in Montgomery.
According to Morrison-Reed, about 500 UU lay people and 250 UU ministers were
present that day. Among the 500 UU lay people was Viola Liuzzo, a housewife,
mother of five and active NAACP member in Detroit. After the march, she drove
protestors back from Montgomery to their homes in Selma. She was heading back
to Montgomery to pick up more marchers when a car filled with Ku Klux Klan
members pulled alongside her and shot her in the head, killing her instantly.
Viola Liuzzo was the only white female protester to die in the civil rights
movement.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are three references to Unitarian
Universalists in the movie “Selma.” I went expecting two and was surprised by
the third and last one, the final note in a movie that celebrates a tipping
point in the Civil Rights Movement fifty years ago just as it inspires today’s
#BlackLivesMatter Movement. The final words of the film are the final words
King spoke that day in Montgomery. They are words he quoted often, words that
hold special meaning to many African Americans and they were written during the
Civil War by Unitarian Julia Ward Howe: “Mine eyes have seen the glory of the
coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath
are stored; He has loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on…. Our God is marching on. Glory, hallelujah! Glory,
hallelujah! His truth is marching on.” And as the crowd responds with “yes sir”
and “speak sir” and “yes” and “alright” we are tempted to join in. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We can be proud of how Unitarian Universalists
participated in Selma, proud of how it changed our religion so that our
professed values match our practiced values, but with this pride comes responsibility.
There is more work to be done, so raise your hands, shout hallelujah and keep
marching. Truth is marching on and we are marching with it!</p>
