<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I recently worshipped with a group called HeartSpace
Spiritual Center in Dallas while visiting family. A friend invited me to
worship there. The same friend, coincidentally, introduced me to Unitarian
Universalism 17 years ago. HeartSpace is a member community of the Centers for
Spiritual Living, an organization formerly known as the Institute of Religious
Science which was founded by Ernest Holmes in 1927. Holmes was greatly
influenced by Emerson, so worshipping with HeartSpace was a lot like visiting
with cousins.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>My husband Frank and I met my friend there thirty
minutes before worship began, choosing to start our worship experience with a
group meditation. It was a good choice - a reminder that just twenty minutes of
meditation a day makes a difference in our lives. The worship experience itself
was filled with soul-stirring singing accompanied by a jazz trio that included
an old friend of Frank's who he's known since high school. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The worship experience was very informal. About
thirty people gathered in a small storefront space, which is rented out for
events by the wine bar next door. The minister's young daughter ran back and
forth from her mother to a caregiver during the service. The group was quite
diverse, the sort of multicultural gathering UUs aspire to. The experience was
heartfelt and authentic. HeartSpace Spiritual Center embodies its name.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The sermon that day was &quot;stump-the-minister.&quot;
We were invited to write a question prior to the service and submit it for her
response. The questions ranged from &quot;how can I deepen my prayer life&quot;
to &quot;how do I know I exist?&quot; (For those of you considering suggesting
that I provide a &quot;stump-the-minister&quot; sermon someday, please refrain
from asking that second question.) The minister handled all of the questions
with grace and wisdom, including inviting input from the lead musician and the
worship associate for their responses to the questions. As to the question
about existence, she quoted Descartes’s famous line &quot;I think therefore I
am&quot; and quoted something from Emerson to further answer the question. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I studied Emerson, and this was like drinking
water to me.&quot; - Ernest Holmes (1887-1960). Read the statement of belief
that Holmes wrote in 1927 or the updated statement at heartspacedallas.org and
you hear Emerson's influence: &quot;We believe that heaven and hell are not
physical places to which we are sent by God, but describe states of mind. God
is unconditional love, and would not create life to destroy or condemn it. When
we tap into the energy of Abundance and Peace, we are in heaven. When we
perceive separation from God, we experience hell.&quot; That's our cousin, a
religious descendant of Emerson, expressing a belief about God.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Many of us would agree with that statement and yet
we choose Unitarian Universalism. Why is that, I wonder? Of course, many of us
agree with that statement in principle but would remove the theistic language. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As we explore this year's theme &quot;People of the
Books&quot;: Towards a Unitarian Universalist Identity we are asking ourselves
many times over: “Why do we continue to choose Unitarian Universalism?” One
possible answer is that we are Unitarian Universalists in order to be a part of
a prophetic congregation. A prophetic congregation chooses to bless the world
with acts of social justice. We choose Unitarian Universalism because we feel
strongly that we have a responsibility to work with however we define the holy
to create heaven here and now.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Rev. Meg Riley writes, “Many Unitarian
Universalists would abandon the idea of prophetic entirely. I have heard UUs
speak instead of congregations that are bold, or visionary, or relevant, or
vital, or justice-seeking. I like all those words, but I like prophetic more,
because of its relationship to time and possibility; it draws from a place deep
in our past and casts our vision around the corner into an unknown future” (<i>A
People so Bold</i>, loc 229). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Our second source – “words and deeds of prophetic
women and men which challenge us to confront powers and structures of evil with
justice, compassion, and the transforming power of love” – invites us to embody
a theology of interdependence. No longer satisfied with a faith tradition that
merely defines our individual response to the holy, many choose Unitarian
Universalism to join in community as the prophetic church. We choose this faith
in order to cast our vision around the corner <u>together</u> into an unknown
future that <u>we</u> help create.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Emerson defined the poet-prophet as an individual
who creates the future with words, opening each generation up to a new
interpretation of reality. It would be inaccurate to associate Emerson with the
prophetic church, however.  Early on in the debate about slavery Emerson is
quoted as saying, &quot;Does he not do more to abolish slavery who works all
day steadily in his garden than he who goes to an abolition meeting and makes a
speech?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Emerson’s statement, similar in ways to Gandhi’s “Be
the change that you wish to see in the world,” is the emphasis on the
individual which still permeates American culture, Unitarian Universalism and
our cousins at the Centers for Spiritual Living. Eventually, Emerson joined the
abolitionist movement but was criticized in his own time for coming to the
movement somewhat late. He has also been criticized by historians who see in
his thought an emphasis on personal spirituality that ignores a connection to
the wider community. Emerson’s gift to Unitarianism in the nineteenth century
was to provide a living language designed to awaken the individual’s inner
life. It is a gift that was not limited to our religion, but that extended to
the whole of American culture. We have to turn to another theologian, in
another century, to take the individual further into community and into a
deeper sense of what it means to be the prophetic church.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Twentieth century Unitarian theologian James Luther
Adams wrote, “The prophetic liberal church is the church in which all members
share the common responsibility to attempt to foresee the consequences of human
behavior (both individual and institutional), with the intention of making
history in place of merely being pushed around by it” (<i>The Essential James
Luther Adams: Selected Essays and Addresses</i>, 112). Adams critiqued
nineteenth century Unitarianism for its avoidance of a theology of evil and its
inability to adequately name sin. The notion of the continued progress of
humanity needs to be tempered with what Adams identified as the “tragic factor
of history.” We must be careful also about our tendency to idolize the
individual. “Be the change you want to see in the world” can lead to a bunch of
individuals expressing their individual opinions about the change they each
want to see. Without community and working out effective social change in
conversation with partners and allies, our social justice efforts fall flat.
Yes, “be the change you want to see in the world,” but also rise up together as
one and be the change that <u>we</u> hope to see.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Rob Keithan writes, “In U.S. society, and perhaps
within Unitarian Universalism especially, our pursuit of transformation tends
to overemphasize one of two extremes. Either we concentrate on personal change
without much regard for larger social factors, or we focus on changing society
without paying sufficient heed to our individual lives and needs” (<i>A People
so Bold</i>, loc 2428). Because ours is a religion of deeds not creeds, we have
a tendency to overemphasize doing over being. It is covenant that can call us
into balance as a prophetic congregation that recognizes the need for
reflection and action. It is covenant that gives us the theological grounding
to find the balance between the two extremes heard here in words by Mark
Belletini:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>Unitarian Universalists
speak up and sigh in silence. This is not an easy faith to have. We reflect and
then we act. We peer around the corner together into an unknown future.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We <u>are</u> more than a collection of individuals
on our own spiritual journeys. The covenant is how we create what becomes the
“more” in our gathering together. Unlike the Centers for Spiritual Living, we
do not have a statement of belief. We have a covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The first covenants were political treaties in the
ancient Near East dating as far back as the fourth century B.C.E. Consequences
for breaking covenants were clearly stated in the covenants themselves. These
ancient political covenants were kept in shrines and holy places because
ancient people saw the gods as active in human history. These covenants may
have been enshrined, but they were also political promises between groups of
people to define territories and to maintain agreements. According to Reverend
Burton Carley, minister of the First Unitarian Church of Memphis, “The Hebrew
people took the political covenant that came before them and elevated it into
another dimension. They used covenant to describe the divine / human
relationship thus imparting to it a deep theological and moral significance.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We can trace the roots of our covenantal faith to
the Protestant Reformation and how it influenced one English minister to lead
his people in the development of a congregational covenant. This congregation
and others like it, who wanted to further remove Catholic elements from the
Church of England, became known as Puritans. We can trace the roots of our
covenantal faith to these Puritans and those among them known as the Pilgrims.
We can also trace the roots of our covenant to the Mayflower Compact, a
document written because walking together, being in covenant with each other,
is often very difficult.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Mayflower didn’t carry one happy band of Pilgrims
covenanted to walk together as friends. Only half of the group came from one
congregation who had escaped religious persecution in England, spent some time
in Holland and from there headed to America. This was the group we call the
Pilgrims, the others on the Mayflower were people the Pilgrims called the
Strangers because they were not from their congregation. Trouble arose when the
ship was unable to land at their intended destination and the two groups found
themselves at odds with each other. The Mayflower Compact, a covenant, was
designed by the leaders of the two groups to create a civic structure that
recognized they needed to walk together in order to survive. In this covenant
can be seen the beginnings of democracy in America. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It was the Puritans of Massachusetts Bay Colony, who
came after the Pilgrims, who gave us the next historic covenant in America. The
Cambridge Platform of 1648 summarized the elements of a congregation’s covenant
and it continues to be the foundation of our covenantal faith today. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Much has been written about the lack of a cohesive
Unitarian Universalist theology because we do not have a binding creed or set
of beliefs. We do not ask you to sign a belief statement when you sign the
membership book. We ask you to covenant with us, to walk with us in the spirit
of love and with mutual respect. This is the teaching of our religion; you
might even call it our theology – the covenant. This promise that we make to
dwell together in peace, to be guided by love, to seek knowledge in freedom, to
respect each other, to join in meaningful action, to use the democratic
process, to affirm the dignity and worth of every human being…. This promise,
this evolving covenant binds us one to the other and to that which calls us out
of ourselves. Our covenantal theology is essentially a theology of
interdependence that calls us to be the prophetic church in a broken and
hurting world.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It probably really isn’t that much of a coincidence
that the same friend who introduced me to Unitarian Universalism invited me to
experience worship with her at the HeartSpace Spiritual Center. She and I have
always been spiritual seekers drawn by the words and deeds of prophet-poets
like Emerson, Thoreau and yes, Ernest Holmes. I have cast my lot with Unitarian
Universalism, not just because it is important to understand the role of the
prophetic church in “making history in place of merely being pushed around by
it.” I am a Unitarian Universalist because ours is fundamentally a theology of
interdependence. Ours is a religion that both nourishes our souls and calls us
to bless the world.</p>
