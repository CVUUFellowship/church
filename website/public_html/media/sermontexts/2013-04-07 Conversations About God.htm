<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I have a small plastic cross with the imprint “God Is
Love.” I imagine I got it when I was eight or nine years old. It glows in the
dark. Or at least it used to. I have kept it all these years on my home altar
alongside other keepsakes. These pieces of my heart include the note my husband
wrote with the first flowers he sent me, a note from our girls celebrating our
engagement officially blending our two families, four photos of Indian gurus,
two other cross icons, a yin yang symbol, a stone with the word happiness
painted on it and a card from a Catholic bookstore with a prayer to consecrate
the family. I’m not taking any chances; I want to include everything I can in
my naming of the holy. Like Nancy Shaffer I want everyone to feel included in
my prayers, but I don’t mean those who would pray with me. I mean I want to be
inclusive in my naming. I want to make sure that the unnamable, the unfathomable
who may or may not be listening, is mentioned in my prayers and represented on
my altar. I want it all on my altar to the Life living in and through me, as
Shaffer invokes in her poem “That Which Holds All”: “Spirit, Holy One, Mystery,
God, Spirit of Life, Spirit of Love, Ancient Holy One, Mystery We Will Not Ever
Fully Know, Gracious God, Spirit of this Earth, God of Sarah, Gaia, Thou….” (“That
Which Holds All” by Nancy Shaffer).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“God Is Love” – a simple phrase for a child to comprehend. A
simple phrase even for a child to begin to question. A child’s first gods are
her parents. By the time she reaches eight or nine, the age I may have been
when I received my plastic cross, the child begins to suspect her gods are not so
perfect. God may not be love all of the time. But in the stories, in the myths
handed from one generation to the next we begin to make sense of our life, even
at a very childish and literal level. “God is Love” written in small block
letters on a cross is simple at first, a hopeful beacon for a child wanting god
to be love all of the time. The word <i>God</i> starts to get a little bit more
complicated as the child grows and learns all of the details of the story of
Love hanging on a cross.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In <i>Dangerous Words: Talking about God in an Age of
Fundamentalism</i> Gary Eberle</span> notes that, “<span style='color:black'>In
polytheistic pagan northern Europe, there were many gods and goddesses, each
with his or her proper name. From conversion on, however, the ancient word God
would be reserved only for the Christian God described in the Bible, a God who
allowed for no other god to be named God.” This is the God most of us reject
when we say we do not believe. This is the God I put away when I stored my
plastic cross in a box with other souvenirs from my childhood, the plastic dinosaur
from the 1964 World’s Fair, a replica of a Native American drum from the
Adirondack Mountains, my first Barbie Doll. So much plastic! Plastic, like god,
has multiple meanings. Plastic also means malleable, pliable and flexible. How
is it that this little plastic cross can really be plastic? Malleable, pliable
and flexible? How can the word god continue to travel with me after being put
away in a box with other childish things? How is it that I can become
comfortable with a little plastic cross sitting in between a picture of
Paramahansa Yogananda and a symbol of the Tao?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In<i> </i>the book <i>What We Talk About When We Talk About
God</i> Rob Bell writes this: “I realize that when I use the word <i>God </i>in
the title of this book there’s a good chance I’m stepping on all kinds of land
mines. Is there a more volatile word loaded down with more history,
assumptions, and expectations than that tired, old, relevant, electrically
charged, provocative, fresh, antiquated yet ubiquitous as ever,
familiar/unfamiliar word <i>God</i>? And that’s why I use it.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Here’s why I use it: I want to be a part of the
conversation. I want to be a part of the conversation represented by Rob Bell’s
book and Gary Eberle’s book and the many other books that are wrestling with
this word - <i>The God Delusion, The Evolution of God, The History of God, Good
without God </i>and on and on. I want to be a part of the interfaith
conversation, the political conversation, the human rights conversation and I
want to bring my gods with me – especially into those conversations that use
the word in ways with which I disagree. I use the word because it is plastic –
malleable, pliable and flexible. When I use the word it carries all the
meanings that it has held throughout my life. It also carries the potential of
meaning so much more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In this year of doing theology together, of discovering
together what it is to kindle the fire deep in our souls and then talk about it
with each other, we have encountered a lot of words along the way. We have
explored a lot of theological themes together. Forgiveness and reconciliation,
covenant, beauty, evil, embodiment, faithfulness, gratitude, mystery and
wonder, Sabbath, joy, death, hospitality, peace and nonviolence, the sacred,
love, grace, suffering, justice, hope and now God. If you are keeping track,
and I hope you are, here is what we have left to cover: interdependence,
prayer, self-care, silence, salvation, and finally, evolution. Last fall in our
“Introduction to Theology” Ablaze class, a member of this congregation very
wisely wondered what words on this list caused him to shut down, to stop the
conversation, to stop listening and to stay in rejection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Even the word love shuts us down sometimes. Even the word
love becomes small, unattainable, turned in on itself. What is your word? Is it
the word sacred, salvation, faith, hope, love? What words do you reject and
why? What words cause you to stop the conversation, to leave the room, to stand
still on your journey? Is it the word God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Notice I did not ask you what you believe. I am asking you
what religious words you use to open your heart, to connect with others, to cry
out with anguish or to shout in praise. Notice that in the video we showed this
morning of congregation members responding to the word God, we did not ask, “do
you believe in God?” We asked, “what do you hear when you hear the word God?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Some of you think of metaphor when you hear the word God.
The realm of metaphor takes us deeper into a place where things aren’t quite as
they seem and startling similarities jolt us into new awareness. God is like
love. God is like a strong mother, a warm father. God is like an “entire ocean
of compassion” (Shaffer). All religious language is metaphoric. It is not a
matter of belief. It is a matter of movement. The best use of religious language
takes us someplace new, towards a place we can never fully understand, never
fully arrive. God is a journey word. It is more poetry than theology that word
God. It is a word that can point beyond literal interpretation if we let it. It
is a word that can retain the innocence of a child believing in love at the
same time it holds the cynicism of an adult who has learned that the literal
God is dead. Philosophers and theologians have worked this out: when the
concrete gods are gone, the divine remains.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The divine remains in metaphor and all religious language
is metaphoric. Gary Eberle says that “The conceptual map of religious language
only works, however, if we know or can remember how to read it. And it is on
this point that we seem stuck today. The scientific modernist looks at the
religious conceptual map as an antiquated chart of a world that doesn’t exist.
The strict fundamentalists, stuck in their literalism, confuse the map with the
terrain it describes” (p. 174). Unitarian Universalists are stuck on this point
too. In 2003 when William Sinkford, then the president of our denomination,
preached a sermon calling for UUs to reclaim a vocabulary of reverence
including the word God, it made the national news. Religious language doesn’t
have to mean we use the word God, but it does mean that we somehow remember to
read the conceptual map of religious language. It means that we continue to
develop a vocabulary of faith that points beyond the map. It may mean that we
venture beyond the uncharted areas of the conceptual map. We may need to go
beyond that place where medieval cartographers proclaimed “here be dragons.” We
may need to wrestle with the literal gods we have rejected in order to find gods
beyond all naming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Right now I do not have a home altar. The table I was using
for it is still in Dallas with my husband Frank. It’s a handmade table we
picked out together – a small plank of wood inserted into side supports carved
with jaguar heads, green marbles are used for their eyes. We bought it in a
shop that specializes in importing Mexican artesanía –folk art made by hand to
be used as home décor. In the Olmec and Mayan traditions the jaguar represents
the ability to move between the “real” world and the “spirit” world. The jaguar
protects the shaman as he moves from the earth to the spirit realm. This jaguar
table seemed an appropriate object for a home altar; another symbol that
pointed beyond itself. Mayan gods depicted as jaguars are gods of the
underworld, gods of the night, gods of fertility and strength. Jaguar gods have
their own names; names they lost in the conquest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Right now I do not have a home altar. I retrieved my
plastic cross with the block letters “God is Love” from a drawer where it has
been residing in a plastic bag along with love notes, four photos of Indian
gurus and other symbols of the divine. It is more than forty years old and may
not retain the ability to glow in the dark, although I spent most of the day
Saturday testing it. I left it sitting under a lamp, hoping to revive its ability
to put forth a bit of light in the dark. By the end of the day when I took it
into a darkened room I think I could see the gleaming outline of a cross. Maybe
it was just wishful thinking – the adult who I’ve become hoping that the
literal message “God is Love” still shines light on my path. Call it what you
will, “love” or “ground of being” or “Spirit of Life.” If I make love one of my
gods I will be on my way to constructing a vocabulary of faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>May all of our vocabularies of faith point beyond the
literal. May we know in our loss of innocence that love can prevail, that there
can be words of our own choosing that open a way for us that is beyond words.
May we choose a path that takes us beyond rebellion into connection, beyond
rejection into a deeper reverence for all of life. May we become one with the
“entire ocean of compassion”, with “That Which Has Been Present Since Before
the Beginning,” with the wind, the rain, with “that which holds all” (Shaffer).
May we enter into this great conversation about God and may we be held.</span></p>
