<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I went to the water for an experience of “the
mind-stretching, jaw-dropping, in-your-face wonder of the universe itself” that
religious naturalist Chet Raymo identifies in a metaphor he created in response
to fundamentalist atheism. In his inverted cliché, he has the “bath water”
stand for all of creation, an object worthy of our awe, thanksgiving and
praise. The baby represents how religion has concretized its symbols, turned
its gods into humans and created a non-existent supernatural world. Raymo
comments that atheists have thrown the bath water out with the baby. Keep the
bath water, but by all means throw out the baby Raymo tells us. Throw out the baby,
the “memes without substance,” the cultural baggage religions have accumulated.
Accumulated, because of our inability to be comfortable with a natural world
that cannot be fully understood or explained. Accumulated, because we refuse to
rest in mystery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The word meme was coined by the evolutionary biologist
Richard Dawkins to explain how ideas are spread throughout a culture. Memes are
carried through writing, speech, ritual and repetition. They can be as inconsequential
as a catch-phrase and as insightful as a philosophical breakthrough. Hoping to
reconnect to a way of being religious that had once helped me to toss out the
“baby,” the memes without substance, I literally and metaphorically went to the
water. “After all,” Raymo writes, “water, as much as anything in our
environment, is an adequate symbol for the creative agency that forges atoms in
the hot interiors of stars, weds oxygen to hydrogen, and wets the Earth with
the stuff of life and consciousness – an agency worthy of attention, reverence,
thanksgiving, praise” (<i>When God is Gone, Everything is Holy</i>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I could have stayed home with the less tepid water of the
Pacific Ocean, but I would have conducted my search alone. I needed 450
colleagues and all of Unitarian Universalism with which to wrestle. Knowing
that a solitary search for the holy would only get me so far, I flew across the
continent to the biannual conference the UU Ministers Association names as the
CENTER Institute for Excellence in Ministry. I went to the Gulf Coast waters in
Florida to reconnect to my call, to learn from colleagues and to deepen my
Unitarian Universalist identity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Many months ago, I signed up for the workshop I would take
for three of the four days I was there. I was excited to choose from titles
like: “Ordained Ministry for A New Millennium: Theologies and Practices of
Re-newal” and “Dancing on the Edge of Meaning: Religious Leadership for a
Multi-Racial, Multicultural and Theologically Diverse World.” The preaching
workshop with the Rev. Dr. James Forbes, named by TIME magazine as one of the
top preachers in the U.S., filled up quickly so the terrifying prospect of
preaching in front of a renowned liberal protestant preacher plus many of my
colleagues thankfully fell of off my list of possibilities early on. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>As much as I love Rebecca Parker, the president of our
Starr King School for the Ministry, I couldn’t quite get excited about her
workshop on ordained ministry for a new millennium. After reading the
description:  “The Puritan inheritance of an apocalyptic and eschatological
imagination has informed our current understandings of prophetic, pastoral, and
counter-oppressive ministry, but these understandings might be further evolved
in light of contemporary contexts. Similarly, the historical relationships
between UU identities and the roles of ordained ministers have shaped our
theologies of sacramental and ritual practice—and yet, how might these
theologies shift now, especially in the context of multi-religious engagement?
How might a post-modern, relational understanding human interchange inform an
evolving ecclesiology in an age of social networking and internet technologies?”
and finding out there was homework to be completed before departure, I signed
up for the “Awakening Bhakti Workshop” which promised to help me express and
share the deepest caverns of my soul and ultimately find the eternal spring of
love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Knowing well the joke about Unitarian Universalists
arriving at the gates of heaven where there are two signs - one pointing to
heaven and the other to a discussion about heaven – I was hoping I had not
signed up for a discussion about chanting the ecstatic songs of ancient India.
My soul was thirsty for the refreshing waters of reverence, thanksgiving and
praise. My soul was yearning to sing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>While 400 of our colleagues were wrestling with ideas like
religion and the American radical tradition, theme-based ministry and member
integration, and practical ways to use ministerial power and authority, thirty
of us were on the top floor of the conference center chanting the names of god.
As we chanted we looked to our right to the Gulf of Mexico and to our left also
– the Gulf. Surrounded by light bouncing off the water, we sang in call and
response to Jai Uttal and a young Hare Krishna drummer by the name of Dharma
Devi Das. In between ecstatic shouts of Sita Ram and Om Nama Shivaya, Jai told
us the stories from the epic Ramayana, the story of Rama (an avatar of the
Hindu preserver-God Vishnu), whose wife Sita is abducted by the king of Sri
Lanka, the demon Ravana. Jai also told us his personal journey from New York
Jew to Bhakti Yoga practitioner. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Jai told us how, at the age of 19, he left New York City for
Northern California to study with the classical Indian musician Ali Akbar Khan.
Jai then began regular pilgrimages to India, living among the Bauls, the
wandering street musicians of Bengal, and singing with the kirtan wallahs in
the temples of his guru. Singing traditional Indian kirtan (sacred chants) deepened
Jai’s connection to the divine and gave him a sense of joy. Like many of his
generation, (Jai first travelled to India in 1971) Jai found that his spiritual
path led East. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We listened, we chanted and we rested. One day after lunch
Jai remarked that we all looked quite tired. He told us to lie down on the
floor and he would sing to us. Like kindergartners taking an afternoon nap, we
sprawled out on the meeting room floor, not meditating, not chanting, in a
floating state of not-doing our souls drinking in the waters of ancient
Sanskrit sung for thousands of years as an act of devotion to the divine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>When I was 19 years old I had a profound meditation
experience when followers of the Siddha Yoga lineage visited my college campus.
The next week a friend and I got lost driving to the meditation center. We never
tried going there again. Years later after meditating with other techniques and
schools, I was reintroduced to Siddha Yoga by a friend who thought the practice
of chanting, meditating and listening to the teachings of Gurumayi
Chidvilasananda would be good for me. I was going through a divorce,
co-parenting my two young children and had recently returned to working
full-time. I was ripe for a change in my spiritual practice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I attended regularly for a few years, even travelling to
the ashram in upstate New York to meet the guru. I attended workshops and
intensives. I chanted the impossibly long Guru Gita. I was even learning to
play the harmonium so that I could help lead the chants at the Dallas center. My
longing for the holy kept leading me to new insights and self-discoveries.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>If you have read the book or have seen the movie, you may
know that Elizabeth Gilbert’s guru in <i>Eat, Pray Love</i> is Gurumayi. You
may also know that Siddha Yoga is rife with controversy, similar to other
power-hungry Gurus that have come out of the complex religious landscape in India;
the Siddha Yoga lineage is not as divine as it purports to be. As soon as I
started hearing the rumors about Baba Muktananda, Gurumayi’s guru, including
allegations of sexual abuse, I stopped attending. Muktananda had been dead for
years, but it didn’t matter to me. I couldn’t be a part of something that
purported a devotion to divine love publicly, but privately kept secret power
struggles and abuse. I left and continued my search for the holy in less
obvious places.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I became a Unitarian Universalist. My meditation practice
is influenced by the many schools I have practiced with, but mostly now it is a
Buddhist practice utilizing techniques I have learned sitting with two Sangha
and reading many books by Western Buddhist teachers. I have given up on enlightenment,
which is something I have in common with Jai Uttal. He joyfully mentioned this
in passing while he gently guided us each in leading our own sung prayer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Jai has given up on enlightenment, but not on singing the
names of god. It connects him to the millions of chanters who for thousands of
years have trusted the ancient power of the mantra. Jai brings kirtan all over
the world, including Israel, where he regained his Jewish identity in a way that
now makes sense to him almost 40 years later. You can hear it in his son’s
name: Ezra Gopal. Ezra, the priest of the Hebrew Scriptures who reintroduced
the Torah in Jerusalem after the Babylonia Exile. Gopal, the infant form of
Lord Krishna.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This is the world we live in: an aging hippie born as a Jew
chooses Bhakti Yoga as his spiritual path. Chet Raymo, a scientist born as a
Catholic, becomes a religious naturalist. This is the Great Awakening the Rev.
Dr. James Forbes preached to us in Florida: it is an Interfaith Great Awakening
this time and Unitarian Universalists are ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We know that everything is holy now. We know that in a
post-Enlightenment, scientific world there are no dualisms. There are no
dualisms of sacred/profane, body/soul, natural/supernatural, matter/spirit, no
heaven/hell.  The scientific story of creation teaches us that the universe is
a unity – “an interacting, evolving, and genetically-related community of
beings bound together inseparably in space and time,” in Raymo’s words (location
954).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>If everything is holy now, does that mean the sacred loses
its meaning of being separate, set apart? If everything is holy now, is nothing
holy? Has the sacred been dragged down to the level of the profane?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>On our last day in Florida, a colleague who had also
chanted the names of god, sat with me for a last few minutes in the sun. She
had also been a one-time member of Siddha Yoga and we were comparing notes.
Another colleague walked by us carrying a shell, taking it to hotel staff with
the hopes of finding out what it was, to find out how to name it.</span></p>

style='color:black'>And all is well now, hush now, close your eyes— (Gjertrud
Schnackenberg)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Chet Raymo concludes that when God is gone, everything is
holy. This is similar to theologian Paul Tillich’s statement that when all of
the concrete Gods are gone, the divine remains. When everything is holy we are
not dragged down to the commonplace, to a place where everything is the same
and nothing is special. When everything is holy we are lifted up into the unity
of creation, into the wonder of the cosmos at play. All is well. Everything is
holy now.</span></p>
