<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are different versions of the Zen story about
the two Buddhist monks who encounter a woman on the side of a rain-soaked road.
This is to be expected from a tradition that uses story and koan to produce an
opening in the mind of the listener. The versions I am aware of are variously
titled: “A Heavy Load,” “You’re Still Carrying Her” and “A Monk with Heavy
Thoughts.” The version I used for the story this morning comes from a
children’s book. This version may be closer to the original:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>As
two Zen monks walked along a muddy, rain-drenched road, they came upon a lovely
woman attempting to cross a large mud puddle. The elder monk stopped beside the
woman, lifted her in his arms, and carried her across the puddle. He set her
gently down on the dry ridge of the road as the younger monk discreetly admired
her charms.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>After
bowing politely to the woman, the two monks continued down the muddy road. The
younger monk was sullen and silent as they walked along. They traveled over the
hills, down around the valleys, through a town, and under forest trees. At
last, after many hours had passed, the younger monk scolded the elder, “You are
aware that we monks do not touch women! Why did you carry that girl?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>The
elder monk slowly turned and smiled. He said, “My dear young brother, you have
such heavy thoughts! <i>I</i> left the woman alongside the road hours ago. Why
are <i>you </i>still carrying her?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>There seems to be a
difference between the adult version of the story and the g-rated version found
in Jon Muth’s telling of the story. In “A Heavy Load” the younger monk is
disturbed by the selfish, rude behavior of the young woman. In the “adult”
version the younger monk is disturbed by the rule-breaking behavior of the older
monk. In both versions the younger monk carries a burden that doesn’t even
belong to him.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>On the surface this story, in any of the versions,
suggests that we carry way too many burdens that do not even belong to us. The
question the older monk asks at the end of the story is also asked of us. “Why
are you still carrying her? Why are you still carrying him? Why are you still
carrying that hurt that was over hours ago, months ago, years ago?” If we dare
to answer the question we will find ourselves in the heart of our own story,
asking ourselves another question: “What does forgiveness look like?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“The concept of atonement has been central in our
theological history. One of the defining works from our heritage is Hosea
Ballou’s <i>Doctrine of Atonement</i>. Yet it is rare to hear this word or
concept used among us in the twenty-first century,” writes UU minister Jeanne
Harrison Nieuwejaar. We would rather use the words forgiveness and
reconciliation, in place of atonement. And we’d rather talk about forgiveness
within the context of Yom Kippur, the Jewish tradition. We would like to avoid
the Christian tradition altogether when it comes to forgiveness. Whether we
consciously know it or not, we are avoiding an outdated twelfth century
philosophical interpretation of atonement that places the human Jesus on a
cross to pay a debt owed to God. It is our Universal heritage that reinvented
and radicalized the doctrine of atonement declaring that all would be reconciled
to God. A twenty-first century Unitarian Universalist vocabulary of faith can
include the word atonement, with or without god. It is one of those dangerous
words that would be good for us to reclaim.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We come to worship today, just days before Yom Kippur,
turning toward love, seeking atonement, at-onement with all of life. The things
we carry, the burdens we refuse to put down stop us in our tracks. We do not
turn. We hold ourselves separate. We have not atoned for what we have done and
who we are. We are not one with all of life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Zen story of the monks who encounter the woman
on the side of the road teaches us the difference between shame and guilt.
Guilt is our healthy reaction to a broken rule, a selfish act or a harsh word
spoken in anger. Guilt is easily mended, easily set down. Shame is our
unhealthy reaction to a violation, a perceived threat, a sense of humiliation.
We carry shame for hours, months and years. It binds us to an on-going cycle of
despair and hurt. It opens wide a hole in our souls that begins to heal the
moment we decide to forgive ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Most of us learn shame in our families. Even those
of us with perfect families learn shame. In fact, having a perfect family may
point directly to the presence of shame. In reality there is no such thing as
the perfect family, even though we have seen them on TV. We may have also seen
them in our neighborhood or at our children’s schools. We are often very
jealous of them. They always dress well, drive the right cars, send their kids
to the most prestigious schools and maintain positions in status organizations
like the Junior League or the Rotary Club. You may remember the ad from a few
years ago: a young boy is feeling left out on his first day at a new school, no
one talks to him as he walks towards the school door, having forgotten his
lunch he runs back to the carpool line where his mother waits driving a new Hummer.
As he walks back towards the school other kids suddenly start to talk to him.
The message? Own the right car and you’ll be accepted. Who you are is what you
drive, how you dress, and what you achieve. Therapists Merle Fossum and Marilyn
Mason outline the different types of families and how they harbor shame in
their book <i>Facing Shame: Families in Recovery</i>. About the “perfect family”
they note that “High-achieving families are often not allowed by others to have
any pain; they look good to all outsiders” (p. 53). They are the perfect
family, remaining separate and apart from all of life by a fear of being found
out. The gift of atonement allows us to set down the burden of perfection
hiding shame, forgive ourselves and turn towards a deeper life of authentic
connection.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We learn shame from our disconnected families,
another type identified by Fossum and Mason. It is easier to cut ourselves off
from siblings and parents than to feel the pain of unresolved hurts. Sometimes
the family has cut us off because of our actions. The disconnection may happen
because of religion. I saw this two years ago when I served churches in Utah
and Idaho. I knew Unitarian Universalist parents who were not allowed to attend
their own children’s weddings at the Mormon Temple. I listened to many painful
stories of adults cut off from parts of their families because they had left
the Mormon Church. I officiated at two memorial services for former Mormons who
had found a religious home in Unitarian Universalism. Their families attended
with varying degrees of discomfort. Some forgiveness and reconciliation had
taken place before death; the remaining healing would be done by disconnected
family members left behind. It may never be appropriate to forgive a family
member who has hurt you deeply. It may be more appropriate to start with
self-forgiveness, choosing to set down the burden of disconnection, regaining
an authentic empathy with yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We learn shame <u>and</u> blame in our families,
getting stuck in a way of life that leads to more shame and despair rather than
accountability and reconciliation. We learn to always place blame on outside
sources. To take responsibility would be too painful. To take responsibility would
mean to acknowledge a vulnerability that unwinds a path to deep pain, pain
we’ve been carrying for not just hours or months, but for years. Almost all of
us have been on the other side of blame, wondering where our responsibility
ends and the other person’s responsibility starts. Setting down the burden of
blame, we forgive ourselves and discover a lost tenderness that turns us
towards a new sense of oneness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We learn shame from our families when they teach us
to hide our true feelings behind niceness. Good families never get angry with
each other we are taught. We love each other because we are nice to each other;
we are nice to each other because we love each other. We are nice because we
have to be. As we learn to forgive ourselves, to set our burden down of who we
think we should be, our wholeness emerges and our ability to turn toward all of
life arises.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Shame hides behind a mask of perfection and a fear
of not being good enough. It chains us to a life lived by rigid rules and
controlling concern. Healing shame begins with an act of forgiveness. Healing
shame we restore the relationship with ourselves, becoming again at-one with
the promise of life renewed. Healing shame we can understand how a holy man can
bless a wrong-doer rather than curse them. Once healed we can run after all
those who have hurt us, calling: “May all your deepest desires be satisfied!” (From
“The Dervish in the Ditch,” a traditional Sufi tale) Learning to lay aside all
we have carried, we now know that when our deepest desires are satisfied we can
turn towards others in love. We can forgive and be made whole.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Once made whole and having tasted the freedom that
forgiveness offers we may now want to take this gift to others, deciding for
them when and how they should forgive. We especially want to teach others about
forgiveness when they have hurt us. As Jeanne Harrison Nieuwejaar points out,
“We are quick to prompt our children to say, ‘I’m sorry.’ It is a good
beginning.” Sometimes it is only that – a beginning. Sometimes relationship
repairing is much more complex than “I said I’m sorry, now why can’t you
forgive me so we can move on.” Sometimes the pain reaches deep into our past
shame. Sometimes the other person has no interest in being converted to our new
forgiveness religion. Forgiveness is not a prescription that we can hand out to
others as a quick remedy. Forgiveness is the final form of love, according to
the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. Even what we perceive in our own minds as a
virtuous act can hurt someone. We are born needing forgiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Many years ago, while visiting Peru, I stood before a
painting depicting the conquest of Atahualpa and the Incan Empire by Spanish
conquistadores led by Francisco Pizarro. Legend has it that Atahualpa was
captured and held for ransom after he refused to recognize the Bible as the
word of God. Never having seen a book before, the Incan leader supposedly
pushed the Bible aside when it was offered to him. This story comes down through
the ages as justification for the destruction of an entire civilization.
Whether this actually happened or not is not important. What is important is
that this story contains the common shame we carry as the human race.
Conquering and conquered intertwined from generation to generation in a common
ache for healing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As our guide described the painting and the
devastation of the vast empire I realized that he still mourned the loss of
this great civilization and he carried anger towards the Spaniards for an act
that was almost five hundred years old. I remember thinking, “What could
forgiveness and reconciliation look like for the victims of the conquest?”
Except that most of the victims are long gone, an entire people wiped out by
violence and disease. What remains is a deep memory of loss, victim and
perpetrator caught up in tangled web of wrong-doing that gets passed from one
generation to the next.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What does forgiveness and reconciliation look like
on a continent bought with blood, developed by an enslaved people and ruled
with the arrogance of a privileged few? It’s a hard question to ask, perhaps
the hardest. We are all bound by a shame that masks our anger and our pain. We
may not know, yet, what forgiveness and reconciliation look like beyond an individual
sense of responsibility and accountability. This willingness to forgive
ourselves is the first step. We set our burden down. We heal the shame that
binds us. We are made whole. We turn towards each other and all of life. We are
at-one with each other and all of life. We are forgiven and forgiving in an
atonement made of our own choosing.</p>
