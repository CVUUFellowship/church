<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Teachers often teach what they need to learn and preachers
often preach what they need to hear. This week’s theme of Sabbath literally
brought me to my knees, but not in prayer. Friday morning, in my haste to eat
breakfast before a morning meeting, I fell on my knees. Racing about in my
office (apparently it is possible to gather enough speed in my small office to
do some damage) I tripped over my computer’s power cord and came crashing down
on my knees. I didn’t even try to break my fall with my hands – they were full.
Rather than dropping the hard boiled eggs, the blueberries, the almonds and the
empty coffee cup I was carrying, I took the full force of the fall with my
knees. Now every time I climb into bed, get down on my hands and knees to play
with the cat, or search for something on the bottom bookshelf I have a painful
reminder to slow down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>United Church of Christ Minister Donna Schaper writes,
“Although the reality of Sabbath as a day of rest has been lost in our busy
society, the sense of Sabbath, as spiritual leisure, is still very much needed
in our time-starved world” (<i>Sabbath Sense</i>, p. 14). I remember Sunday as
Sabbath. Attendance at church was always followed by the Sunday afternoon meal
where we sat together as a family, marveling at my mother’s culinary skills. I
remember the end of Blue laws when we could finally stop at our favorite
neighborhood store on the way home from church for a sweet treat or a forgotten
item from the weekly shopping. When we moved to Texas from Illinois I marveled
at the curious site of those items not for sale on Sundays. The grocery stores
would be open, but certain items were roped off, beyond reach of Sunday
shoppers. The blue laws that remain on the books in Texas stipulate that car
dealerships must remain closed on either Saturday or Sunday, at the option of
the dealer. Any alcohol (beer and wine only) cannot be bought on Sundays before
noon. Liquor stores are closed on Sundays. People should be in church on Sunday
mornings. At the least, they should not be drinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Blue laws are not just about Sundays. In Massachusetts and
Connecticut blue laws dating to the Puritans of the 17th century still prohibit
most retail stores, including grocery stores, from opening on Thanksgiving and
Christmas. Sabbath is not just for us to keep, but it is also a way of allowing
all workers access to expansive time. It may be convenient to start our holiday
shopping Thanksgiving evening, but it also promotes a cultural norm that values
doing over being.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“Type-A” Unitarian Universalists will want to take up the
cause and immediately start protesting the abuse of workers forced by low wages
to work on holidays. This is not the point. The point is to stay home, create
Sabbath rituals of our own and then perhaps tomorrow take up the task of
crafting a letter to the editor proclaiming the need for a livable wage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We can stay home. We can keep the Sabbath. We can learn to
do nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We can learn how to do nothing from wikiHow, “a
collaborative effort to create the world’s most helpful how-to guides.” wikiHow
is like Wikipedia in that anyone can write or edit an entry. It took 123
authors working through 482 revisions to create a list of eight “somethings” to
teach us “how to do nothing,” raising the question “is it really possible to do
nothing?” The first how-to on the list sets the tone:</span> “<span
style='color:black'>1. Schedule quiet time. Whether it's an hour, a day, a
week, a month, or year of doing nothing, cancel all of your appointments for
that block of time” (<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Do-Nothing">http://www.wikihow.com/Do-Nothing</a>).
I have never met anyone capable of doing nothing for a whole year. Even
ministers, who can take up to seven months of sabbatical leave after seven
years of service, are doing something during their sabbatical time. The
expectation is that the minister will use sabbatical time for study, education,
writing, meditation, and other forms of professional and religious growth. </span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We are not wired to “do nothing.” Even the 123 authors of
the list of eight acknowledge that doing nothing can create anxiety. They issue
a warning at the end of their list, cautioning the reader that they may feel
nervous, sad, or restless when first attempting to do nothing. Relax, they tell
us. The ultimate goal of doing nothing is so that we can become more productive
and creative, ultimately enhancing our ability to do more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In the long run, learning how to do nothing does not take
us deeper into Sabbath. Tom Owen-Towle, the author of <i>Theology Ablaze</i>
gives us a better question than “is it really possible to do nothing?” He says
that the consummate theological query comes from Antoine de Saint Exupery who
asks, “What are you worth when motionless?” I am one of those “type-A”
Unitarian Universalists who finds this question very difficult to answer.
Rarely motionless, I would rather come crashing down on my knees than drop all
it is I am holding in my arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Observant Jews look to the Sabbath as separate from
ordinary time. By late Friday afternoon those who keep the Sabbath are
preparing themselves by bathing, putting on their Sabbath garments and getting
ready for the special meal. Sabbath begins at sunset and ends when three stars
have appeared Saturday night. During the meal, particular Sabbath foods are
served. During the Sabbath there is time for reading and studying the Torah,
synagogue worship and rest. Sabbath is marked with ritual handed down over
time; it is one way Jews learn and reaffirm their identity as Jews. Sabbath
ends with the <i>havdalah</i> (translated as separation), a ritual that
indicates the end of holy time and the beginning of ordinary time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Donna Schaper writes that Sabbath also means to separate.
“Sabbath is the separation of time into different parts. Sabbath is neither
rest nor labor but the separation of the two. Sabbath is the pause between
them,” she writes (p. 20-21).  Not completely motionless during Sabbath, the
action we do take is to separate ourselves from the sameness of our days during
ordinary time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>During ordinary time we are driven by a Protestant work
ethic distorted by a sense that we might not be “good enough.” If we just work
hard enough perhaps we will be good enough. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We equate salary with worth. You can see it in the current
debates over the distribution of wealth in this country. The idea that somehow a
highly paid CEO works harder than his minimum-wage earning employee to reach
the top of his profession distorts the idea that hard work equals success,
equals wealth, equals happiness. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Very few of us work a 40-hour week anymore. We complain
about it as if it were a badge of honor. It proves after all that we are worth
something – look how hard we work! We are our accomplishments. We fear that we
may not be worth anything when motionless, so we keep moving, keep achieving,
proclaiming “no rest for the weary” and celebrate our test scores, our grades,
our salaries and our possessions as if those were the only measures that
mattered. We forget that our accomplishments are only temporary and they are
not who we are. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Who we are when motionless is pure potential. We need
Sabbath time to separate who we think we should be from who we are becoming.
This is not to say that work can never make us happy. Work as vocation can call
us to our authentic selves. Without Sabbath we may not hear that call. Without
Sabbath rituals to remind us of our true selves we can get lost in an ordinary
time that exhausts and overwhelms. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We do not have to wait until the end of the week for
Sabbath time. We can set aside just a few minutes each day to pause, to become
more mindful, to stop rushing, to stop multi-tasking. We can set down all that
we hold in our arms and wait. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We can also recognize the rituals we already have in place
that provide us a sense of Sabbath. These may be as simple as taking a morning
break and enjoying a cup of tea in a special cup or going out to eat once a
week with our family. Sabbath can be found when we take the time to notice how
we “take” our time, how we spend our time, how we give away our time. Sabbath
reminds us of the value of time. It also reminds us that we have value outside
of time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>My body is adjusting to a different way of experiencing
Sabbath. When my children were young I returned to church, joining a small
Presbyterian church to sing in the six-member choir. Sunday was a day of rest
and ritual, from the early morning choir rehearsal to the conversations at
coffee hour. Entire weekends were set aside from ordinary time. As a stay-at-home
Mom this was the time to hand the kids off to their Dad, to run errands, to
attend soccer games. Sunday was slower than Saturday and was reserved for the
great American rituals of watching football, creating the family evening meal
and the long afternoon nap. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Sabbath changed for a short time after our divorce. I left the
small Presbyterian church feeling that I wasn’t receiving the support I needed
as I walked through the end of my marriage. It was as if who I was becoming no
longer fit within the walls of that Sunday space. I took up a new Sabbath
practice. Every other Sunday when I had custody of my girls we went to the
local waterpark, which naturally was empty because most everyone else was at
church. The water held me in motionless exhaustion while my children splashed
and played around me. As we discovered who we now were as a family, the summer
ritual of water, sun and play shaped a new identity. The Sabbath ritual gave us
the pause between the rest and labor of a shifting ordinary time. I was no
longer a stay-at-home Mom. My girls now lived in two different homes. We needed
ritualized time to in Schaper’s words, “ritualize the chaos of modern life.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Eventually we went back to church, First Unitarian Church
of Dallas, where our Sabbath ritual included choir, religious education,
worship, volunteering for countless pancake breakfasts and the deepening of the
commitment to our newly chosen faith. Sunday afternoons were left unplanned as
Frank and I learned how best to blend our families and share Sabbath-time with
our former spouses and extended families. Now that I am a minister Sunday is no
longer my Sabbath. My body is still adjusting to Monday as my Sabbath. My mind
is still adjusting to Monday as Sabbath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In attempting to heed the Hebrew scripture’s commandment to
remember the Sabbath and to keep it holy (Exodus 20:8), I have discovered that
is not enough to take a break from emails and phone calls and to-do lists. I
must also take a break from thinking about emails, phone calls and to-do lists.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I could listen to the 123 authors of “How to do nothing”
and turn off my phone and computer. I do attempt to practice other suggestions
from their list including sitting quietly on the beach and meditating. I have
discovered that it is my constant focus, my constant thinking about the to-dos,
the musts and the shoulds of ordinary time that prohibits me from remembering
the Sabbath and keeping it holy. This is the most difficult Sabbath-taking I
have encountered. I long to be still, to separate my time into different parts,
to pause between rest and labor, but I don’t know how.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Perhaps I could get some help from the seven authors of
“How to Have Fun on Sabbath” posted on wikiHow. The eight-steps for this how-to
include: nature walks, napping, going to the dog park, playing bible board
games, reading a good book, taking pictures, inviting friends over, and writing
or reading a wikiHow article. There are some good suggestions on this list.
Going to the dog park could be awkward. I’m not sure if my cat would enjoy it.
I might draw attention to myself if I went alone, without a dog, so I might
have to adjust this suggestion to my unique situation. Playing bible board
games – I might also have to adjust this suggestion to my unique situation. Traditionally
the Sabbath is to be spent reading and studying religious and inspirational
texts, but my ordinary time is filled with this study. My Sabbath might include
a good novel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The reality of Sabbath as a day of rest has been lost in
our busy society. We are so afraid that who we are when motionless is not good
enough that we have forgotten how to slow down. As spiritual sojourners here
for such a brief time we can learn to set down all we hold in our hands and in
our minds. We can be drawn to our knees in rest and contemplation. We can
withdraw into the holy time of Sabbath and emerge more fully alive into an
ordinary time filled with meaning and with purpose.</span></p>
