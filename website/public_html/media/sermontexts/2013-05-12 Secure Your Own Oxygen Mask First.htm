<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I have flown enough times now to feel secure in my
knowledge of all of the safety instructions given by the flight attendants over
a public address system that makes people sound like the parents in the Peanuts
television specials from my youth. The “wah, wah, wah” of the instructions has
become background noise to my efforts to compose last minute text messages and
to play one last game of solitaire on my phone. Even when the announcement is a
high-quality video of computer graphics showing me how to buckle my seatbelt
and use my seat as a flotation device, I barely pay attention. I am a seasoned
flyer; I’ll know what to do in the case of an emergency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Luckily I haven’t ever experienced a real emergency while
flying. Sure there have been several flights with rough skies where we’ve been
told to stay in our seats with our seatbelts fastened. I’ve never been on a
flight where the oxygen masks have been deployed, dropping down from above like
the gods in ancient Greek dramas. While the other instructions seem mostly
routine to me and I have stopped listening to them out of a general boredom,
the instructions about tugging on the mask to make sure the oxygen is flowing
freely seems mostly terrifying to me. I have stopped listening to that
particular instruction mainly out of the fear that the image instills in me. If
the bag doesn’t have to be inflated to indicate that the oxygen is actually
flowing then how will I know that I’m getting enough oxygen? Will I start to
gasp and struggle for air? And if I am gasping and struggling, will I be able
to get the flight attendant’s attention in time to save me from asphyxiation? 
I no longer listen to that particular instruction because I have chosen to lead
a life free from fear.</span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";

</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The other instruction, always included with the seemingly
simple task of getting the oxygen flowing properly, is this: “if you are
traveling with small children or anyone else in your care, make sure to secure
your own oxygen mask first before making sure their oxygen mask is properly in
place.” Thankfully my children are grown, so I do not feel compelled to listen
to this even more terrifying instruction. If confirming the flow of oxygen
seems vague for my own self-preservation, how can I be entrusted with verifying
this fact for anyone in my care?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>As a seasoned flyer I have experienced my share of rough
skies, including one particularly harrowing moment last summer when I returned
to California from Texas with my youngest daughter. We had a stopover in
Albuquerque, apparently one of the more difficult airports to land given the
wind that blows through the mountains that surround the runway. I had never
flown into Albuquerque before and had not realized it might be difficult to
land a plane there until I experienced the narrative from the man sitting in
the seat behind me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>His assessment of the nature of landing a plane at the
Albuquerque airport began after our first failed attempt to land. His narrative
ended after our third or fourth failed attempt; apparently he realized that
even his expertise couldn’t fully analyze our situation. The pilot also stopped
talking to us after our third or fourth failed attempt. In the silence of our
continued attempts to land, my daughter and I clutched each other’s hand. The
woman in the seat next to us got sick. And I tried desperately to remember how
– just in case I needed to – how to secure my oxygen mask so I could help my
daughter secure hers. Zoe was twenty years old at the time and the mere fact
that she was holding my hand – something she hasn’t done since she was ten
years old – suggested that I needed to take care of her. She might be a young
adult, but I will always be her mother. As such, I will always need to make
sure I take care of myself before I can properly offer her my care.</span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";

</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Tom Owen-Towle, the author of <i>Theology Ablaze</i>, says
that “Unitarian Universalist culture is acknowledging that authentic self-care
is among the most important gifts a congregation can grant to itself as well as
to each of its members” (25). He outlines six areas of self-care writing that, “we’re
beckoned to nourish, on a daily basis, the entirety of our beings – body,
spirit, heart, mind, soul, and conscience” (p. 255). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Our bodies formed in our mother’s body, knitted together by
the genetics of both parents forming the basis for our health histories and
predictable lifespans. Just as our bodies are handed over to our mother’s
breasts and our parents efforts to tenderly carry us through childhood
illnesses and broken bones, our bodies are eventually handed over to the
separate selves we become. We carry the responsibility for our own bodies, a
responsibility once carried by those who learned that they could not protect us
from every bump and bruise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Just as a mother may have kissed a “boo-boo” or a father
picked us up from a fall off a bicycle, we can learn to meet our own physical
needs with a tenderness that is more about acceptance than achievement. When we
learn to look at ourselves in the mirror and really love what we see there,
then perhaps we have finally learned the unconditional love that most parents
set out to learn the moment that little body is placed in their arms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>As a hospital chaplain I learned to ask people, “how is
your spirit?” If I asked them “how are you,” they answered with the perfunctory
“I’m fine.” I would then tease them about being in the hospital and being fine
and then ask instead, “how is your spirit?” How are you feeling? How are you
connecting to a sense of something larger than your finite body, confined to
this hospital room in this moment in time? How do you sense yourself as more
than just this body? And if you have a spiritual practice, how does it take you
to a place beyond your sense of self as separate and alone? How is your spirit?</span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Here in this congregation we put our spirits alongside our
hearts, nurturing spiritual courage. Recognizing that the word courage comes
from the French word for heart (<i>coeur</i>), aspiring to be spiritually
courageous beings, we step out with our hearts in our hands while exploring
theological themes like prayer, self-care and salvation. We step out into the
vulnerable spaces in between us looking for how our hearts will break open
rather than how our hearts will be shattered into a thousand unrecognizable
puzzle pieces.  When we apply the theological theme of self-care to our hearts
we apply our Unitarian Universalist first principle and affirm our own inherent
worth and dignity. We aspire to live as wholehearted beings, knowing that
connection is why we are here. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We are asked to heed the guidance of reason in our
theological explorations as Unitarian Universalists, not to worship our
intellects at the expense of the other five areas of self-care. We proudly
share statistics that annually place UUs at the top of the list of SAT scores
by religion (followed closely by Jews and Quakers) as if the Bible verse was
“You will know them by their brains,” not “You will know them by their fruits”
(Matt 7:16). If we are to be known by our fruits, our actions, then let us be
known as a people who bring our minds to church with us, not as a people who
make of our minds just another idol. As we take care of ourselves as maturing,
ever-seeking spiritual wanderers our minds can be the center of a spiritual
practice grounded in reading and journaling gathered from the six sources of
our living tradition. We gain wisdom along with knowledge. Self-care, taken
seriously, means there is balance in all six areas. The intellect doesn’t
always get to lead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The fifth area of self-care, soul, is difficult to define.
Thomas Moore, author of <i>Care of the Soul</i>, acknowledges this when he
writes, “Definition is an intellectual enterprise anyway; the soul prefers to
imagine. We know intuitively that soul has to do with genuineness and depth, as
when we say certain music has soul or a remarkable person is soulful” (xi). As
a Jungian, Moore also knows that soul has to do with our shadow side. When we
take care of our shadow side, we face our fears. We pay attention when the
fear-inducing part of the safety instructions is given by flight attendants.
When we care for our soul, we know that it is impossible to live a life free
from fear. Self-care teaches us that it is possible to sit with our fear, to
hold each other’s hand while terrified as the plane circles one more time after
it has failed to land. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The sixth self-care zone is conscience, which is a thing
separate from our beloved brain. It is the experience of taking care of ourselves
as we would take care of others. As the writer Natalie Goldberg puts it: “We
have a responsibility to treat ourselves kindly; then we will treat the world
in the same way.” Compassion for ourselves leads directly to compassion for
others. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“If you are traveling with small children or anyone else in
your care, make sure to secure your own oxygen mask first before making sure
their oxygen mask is properly in place.” This could be one of life’s little
instructions, if only we would pay attention.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Most of us read self-care literature as if the words on the
page were meant for someone other than ourselves. If my daughter knew about the
six areas of self-care her life would be so much better. If my partner would
only read this paragraph then we would all be so much happier. If my son would
even pick up Thomas Moore’s <i>Care for the Soul</i> then he would know what
I’ve been talking about all these years. We ignore the instructions to secure
our own oxygen mask first; especially those of us who are parents. Especially
those of us who are mothers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Anne Lamott warns that, “No one is more sentimentalized in
America than mothers on Mother’s Day.” I agree and I also agree with her when
she writes that “no one is more often blamed for the culture’s bad people and
behavior” than mothers. Lamott worries that Mother’s Day “celebrates a huge lie
about the value of women: that mothers are superior beings.” </span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I worry that we have forgotten the radical roots of
Mothers’ Day which was founded by two liberal religious women, including
Unitarian Julian Howe, to promote issues that affected women, not just mothers.
As we muddle through the political correctness of honoring good and bad
mothers, gay and straight mothers and those who may simply embody the spirit of
mothering, may we honor those who taught us how to care for ourselves. May we
honor those who taught us how to pay attention when the instructions were given
to take care of ourselves first. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The plane finally landed in Albuquerque, after four or five
times of dropping down into turbulence and back out after each failed landing.
Once we were past the turbulence and on our final, successful descent, the
pilot finally got back on the loudspeaker and told us what had been going on.
The air flaps had failed to engage. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Our fumbled attempts at landing had nothing to do with the
wind or the mountains – natural causes. We were held in the air by a mechanical
failure – one that finally resolved itself. As the wheels slammed to the
ground, my daughter let go of my hand. I gave my water bottle to our sick seat
mate and everyone applauded when the plane lurched to a stop. The oxygen masks
weren’t needed that time, but the next time I fly I’m going to pay more
attention to how it is that I am instructed to take care of myself first so
that I can better take care of those around me.</span></p>
