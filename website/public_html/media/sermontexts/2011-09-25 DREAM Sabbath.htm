<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>“Loud voices urge us to choose fear, denial, reactionary nationalism, and
racism. We must resist and choose the better way urged by every major religious
tradition.” – Rev. Peter Morales UUA President</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Communities from every major religious tradition have joined together for
DREAM Sabbath 2011, a time for education, reflection, action and solidarity. In
December of 2010, the DREAM Act was just 5 votes short of passing and ensuring
that millions of immigrant children can stay in the United States, their home. This
year, on June 28th, the hopes of immigrant children were revived by a hearing
held on the DREAM Act, chaired by Senator Richard Durbin. In California, our
version of the DREAM Act passed the state assembly in May. Public support for
positive immigration reform is gaining momentum. Our witness is needed to keep
moving forward to choose the better way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Just as positive immigration reform is gaining momentum, the voices of
fear and racism grow louder. Deportations, including deportations of
DREAM-eligible youth and young adults, are continuing in unprecedented numbers.
Our witness is needed to stop the deportations, calling on the Obama administration
to grant deferred action to DREAM students. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Thousands of hard working young people who were brought to the United
States as infants or children can be locked up in federal detention centers and
deported to a country they‘ve never known. The DREAM Act would stop the
injustice by giving students who have grown up and graduated high school in the
United States the opportunity to earn legal status through college or military
service. As people of faith, our witness is needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Gaby Pacheco witnessed her parents and her sisters taken away from her
during a raid in her home by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Witness has many meanings including to “see and hear by personal presence
and perception,” which is what Gaby did when her family was taken away. Witness
also means to “testify to; give evidence of.” In Greek the word which became
martyr was used similarly as we use the word witness today. As the Christian
faith spread and people bore witness to their faith they were called martyrs,
simply those witnessing to their faith. It was later when Christians became
persecuted and killed for witnessing to their faith that the word martyr took
on the meaning we ascribe to it today. The roots of witness contain the
ultimate sacrifice of martyrdom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>The word witness retains the meaning of testifying to one’s faith, not
something that most of us are comfortable with. In a religion that claims the
supremacy of deeds over creeds, our testifying is done in public acts of
witness. Gaby Pacheco’s public act of witness is made more powerful by what she
witnessed privately when her family was taken away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Gaby’s parents came to this country from Ecuador when she was 7. She was
the highest ranked Junior R.O.T.C. student in her high school, and she received
the highest score on the military‘s aptitude test. The Air Force tried to
recruit Gaby but she was unable to enlist because she did not have legal
status. Since then, Gaby has earned two associates degrees in education and a
BA in special education. Gaby has also served as the president of her student
government and the president of Florida‘s Junior Community College Student
Government Association. Gaby‘s dream is to teach autistic children. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Gaby is also one of four students we just saw in the video, “Trail of
Dreams.” These four students walked all the way from Miami, Florida, to
Washington, D.C. – 1,500 miles – in order to build support for the DREAM Act in
2010. Despite the disappointment and the danger of deportation, Gabby continues
to speak out for immigrant students who want to take part in the American
dream. She bears witness to the truth “that we are connected, that we are all
in this together” (Morales).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Unitarian Universalists are being asked to witness for immigrant justice
in Phoenix at our annual General Assembly in June of next year. <span lang=EN
style='color:black'>The issue of whether to boycott Phoenix as the site of the
2012 GA had been hotly contested among UUs after the passage of Arizona Senate
Bill 1070, which empowers local police to check the immigration status of those
otherwise detained. Many thought the appropriate action would be to “witness”
with our money, refusing to spend it on a convention center, hotels and meals in
Arizona. Others thought the best way to witness, to testify as a people of
faith, was to go to Phoenix with acts of service and public witness. In the end
the decision was made to create a special justice GA, one that would minimize
the business of our association and maximize witness and service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>The Reverend Sean Parker Dennison,
minister of our congregation in San Luis Obispo, commented last night on his
blog about a recent meeting of the planning committee for the Justice GA: “One
of our partners in this work B Loewe, Communications Director at</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%;text-autospace:none'><span lang=EN
style='color:black'>National Day Laborer Organizing Network, started our time together
with a reflection on three goals we might share for this experiment we call
‘Justice GA’: 1. Build power for the local communities by using our resources,
privilege, and access (especially to the media) to draw attention to the
struggle in Arizona and the deeper inequities and injustices it reveals. 2.
Shrink disbelief among our own people and among people throughout this nation
who think and say, ‘I just can't believe our government would do these
things&quot; or &quot;I didn't know it was so bad.’ 3. Enlarge compassion”
(used with Sean’s permission).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>What are the deeper inequities and
injustices the law in Arizona reveals? Aren’t “these people” here illegally and
shouldn’t they be punished for breaking the law? “</span>Being in the country
without documentation is actually a civil<span style='color:black'> </span>offense,
much like exceeding the speed limit while driving. If you’re going 50 mph in a<span
style='color:black'> </span>35 mph zone, you are breaking the law, but does
that make you an ‘illegal driver’?” (UUA curriculum “Immigration as a Moral
Issue”) Our immigration system is broken. Visa quotas limit even those with
family connections to 226,000 green cards a year. Due to application processing
backlogs, the wait for a permanent residency visa for those with family
sponsorship ranges from two or three years to over twenty, depending on other
factors including one’s country of origin (“Immigration as a Moral Issue”).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Border enforcement tightened in 1994, the same time NAFTA, the North
American Free Trade Agreement, was put in place and again after 9/11. Americans
have been unwilling to accept that the economic integration agreed to in NAFTA
needs to be extended to the labor markets as well. The U.S. continues to
separate labor from free trade, spending large amounts of money to
unsuccessfully control the border. There is a flawed guest worker program which
favors the skilled worker and invites abuse of the unskilled worker. <span
lang=EN style='color:black'>The deeper inequities and injustices the law in
Arizona reveals</span> are the twin prejudices of race and class. Most
undocumented migrants are poor and uneducated. Could it be that the U.S. is
more willing to offer temporary visas to those who look more like the majority
of our population?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Loewe’s second point, “shrink disbelief,” happened to me when I learned
that it was restrictions put in place during the Clinton administration that
caused migrants to start taking new crossing points including more dangerous
parts of the Rio Grande and more isolated areas. Once migrants began to take
nontraditional routes into the country, they also spread out to different parts
of the U.S. Clinton’s “prevention through deterrence” did not work. Yes our
government does these things and yes, even our liberal lawmakers enact policies
that seriously compromise human rights. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Last year while serving a congregation in Salt Lake City, I received a
call from a man who wanted to learn more about the church. He was excited to
have found us. He was a gay man who had grown up as a Southern Baptist. He had
read our web site and was excited to find an accepting religious community in
Salt Lake City, Utah. We made an appointment to meet and I looked forward to
telling him more about our liberal faith. And then I received this email:</p>

Society as an individual church (if I may use the term),  engage in any type of

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>This is what I wrote back: “Thanks for letting me know. I wish you the
best on your continued journey.” That’s it. I didn’t fire back with material
from the UUA’s “Immigration as a Moral Issue” explaining why criminal is not
the right description for those who risk their lives to cross the border to
find work to support their families. Being in the country without proper
documentation is a civil offense, not a criminal one. Labeling undocumented
workers as criminals fuels the denial about our broken system and lacks
compassion for 11 million of our brothers and sisters who are here to escape
political and economic hardship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>I also did not point out that homosexual acts were once considered
illegal and many gays were labeled as criminals and even mentally ill. I did
not direct him to our Standing on the Side of Love Campaign with its two causes
of marriage equality and immigration reform. I just wished him well, breathed a
sigh of relief that he had not paid a visit to me in person and then wondered
if I should have done more. I had failed to engage this man in a conversation
that would enlarge his compassion. I had not witnessed to my faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>For the most part witnessing to our faith no longer requires the ultimate
sacrifice. There are still places in the world, like Africa, where Unitarian
Universalists take risks standing on the side of love with our GLBT brothers
and sisters. We may get arrested when protesting an unjust law or an
environmentally dangerous decision by the government, but for the most part we
are not asked to die for our faith. There is a sort of death that we can experience
when we are asked to witness. It is the death of the self that clings to the
thought that who we are and what we are doing is not enough. Our actions are
too small; the work needed is too overwhelming. If we allow ourselves to
experience this death, this ego-death, truly embrace that who we are is enough,
what we offer the world is enough we can stand as a witness to a faith that
affirms the inherent worth and dignity of every person and know that we are all
connected; we are in this together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>The most effective witness comes from this place of self-acceptance; an
acknowledgment of where our passion meets the world’s need is true compassion.
Find out what’s happening in this community with the so-called “Secure
Communities” Program or the treatment of migrant farmworkers or respond to a
friend’s uninformed email with the facts. Go to Justice GA in Phoenix in June
of 2012. I’ll be there. I hope you’ll go with me.</p>
