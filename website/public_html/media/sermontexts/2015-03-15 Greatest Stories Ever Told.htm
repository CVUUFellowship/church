not that I hadn’t noticed it before; objections from conservative Christians to
the so-called “war on Christmas” have been going on for a very long time. And
there have been numerous battles with fundamentalist Christians over displaying
crosses or the Ten Commandments on government property, allowing prayer in
public schools, excluding the teaching of Evolution to children (or including
so-called “Creationism” as an equally-valid concept), etc.; it’s been going on
since I was a child – which means a very long time!</span></p>

that particular year at Christmas is when I – who was raised as an Episcopalian
and in many ways is still tied to that tradition – gained a heightened sensitivity
to what it might feel like to be a non-Christian in America. It was a humbling
experience.</span></p>

then the following Christmas, the issue came to a head not far from home – in
Santa Monica; you may remember hearing about it. Apparently since the 1950s,
the city of Santa Monica has allowed a series of fourteen Nativity scenes to be
displayed in the park during the month of December. A few years ago, a man
described as “a local atheist,” Damon Vix, objected to the scenes because the
park is public land – paid for by the residents of Santa Monica. Mr. Vix began
protesting by erecting signs with more humanist messages – such as a quote by
Thomas Jefferson: “Religions are all alike – founded upon fables and
mythologies.” But he went fur<a name="_GoBack"></a>ther than that; he and
(quote/unquote) “other atheists” applied for dozens of spaces in the park to
set up their more inclusive displays. </span></p>

200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And
then – I guess because too much space was being filled up in the park with
displays – the Santa Monica City Council held a lottery for spaces – and the
atheists won the majority of them! This left only a few spaces for the people
in charge of the Nativity scenes (which only tells me that God not only is in
favor of religious inclusivity, but loves a good practical joke!).</span></p>

some folks didn’t understand the humor <u>or</u> the American values of
religious freedom, and began vandalizing the atheists’ displays. So finally the
City Council voted unanimously to ban <u>all</u> unattended private displays
from city parks – essentially ending both the Nativity scenes and the
non-Nativity ones. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>What
really caught my attention, however, in reading about this brouhaha, was the
statement by one of the Nativity scene supporters, who said it’s a “sad day for
freedom of…religion when a small group of people with an ideological ax to
grind succeed in censoring <i>the greatest story ever told</i>.”</span></p>

200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And
I thought to myself: But this is exactly the point! While the story of the
birth of Jesus – and of his entire life and death, actually – <i>is </i>a
“great” story – but it’s only <i>one</i> great story; there are numerous others
from other traditions throughout the year! And the government can’t decide
which of these stories is “the greatest!” <i>That’s</i> what’s meant by
“freedom of religion” in our Constitution.</span></p>

200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>My
mother was a devout Episcopalian. She dragged all five of us kids to church
every Sunday, and made us read the Gospel and Epistle for any Sunday we stayed
home sick. She read us Bible stories when we were young, helped us say prayers
at bedtime, and made sure we got confirmed in the church at the appropriate
time.</span></p>

she never, <i>ever</i> would have suggested that Christianity was the only true

Indeed, I used to joke that she had only herself to blame for my becoming a

young, and so convinced that the main role of religion was to spread kindness and

mother didn’t know a lot about the festivals and stories of other religions;
but I suspect she would have gotten a kick out of the Hindu “Festival of
Colors,” which falls on the last full moon day of the lunar month of Phalgun – March
6<sup>th</sup> this year; and is marked by people throwing colored powder and
liquids at each other! (Sounds a bit like Paintball, but not quite as messy,
and without toy guns that look life-like!)</span></p>

festival is apparently especially raucous in India, where colored water is
squirted on passersby, and people are dunked into muddy water. I read that
people can get away with anything during Holi by simply saying, “Oh, don’t mind
it; it’s Holi!”</span></p>

of the most treasured stories behind this festival is that of Lord Krishna and
his bride, Radha. Long before they married, when they were still quite young,
Krishna asked his mother why he had such dark skin, when Radha’s was so light.
His mother jokingly suggested that Krishna smear some colored powder on Radha
and change her skin to whatever color he’d prefer; and so he did! Thus the
practice of throwing colored powder or water at people.</span></p>

is a calmer element to Holi, which my mother would have also liked. It is a
time for family members to get together, exchange gifts, eat special foods and
decorate their homes; sounds a lot like Christmas! It is considered to be one
of the liveliest and most beloved festivals of the Hindu calendar; and the
stories behind it – there are more than I have time to share this morning – are
pretty great!</span></p>

upset his father – the King, who had wanted his son to follow in <i>his</i>
footsteps, living a life of luxury and power. So he forbid Siddhartha to go
outside the palace gardens, for fear that he would see the suffering in the
world, and want to do something to fix it – like becoming a political or
religious leader! Instead, he found a bride for Siddhartha by age 17, who
became pregnant with their son soon after the wedding.</span></p>

that didn’t satisfy Siddhartha; he was restless to see what lay beyond the
palace, and finally convinced his father to let him go out. Once out on the
streets of Nepal – despite his father’s order that anyone old or disabled or
poor be kept out of his son’s sight – the young man <i>did </i>see people in
great stress and unhappiness; and he was never able to get these images out of
his mind.</span></p>

day, as you probably know, he settled himself beneath a Bodhi tree, vowing to
himself that he would not move from there until he discovered the answers to
his questions. And, according to some Buddhists, on the night of the full moon
in the month of May, complete Enlightenment came to him, bringing him a sense
of deep peace, an understanding of the true nature of all living beings, and an
acceptance of the natural cycle of life and death. From then on he became known
as the Buddha – the “Awakened One.”</span></p>
