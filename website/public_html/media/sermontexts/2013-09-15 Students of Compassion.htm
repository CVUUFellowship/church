<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Students of
Compassion</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>© Rev. Lora
Brandis </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Preached at the Conejo
Valley Unitarian Universalist Fellowship </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>September 15, 2013</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Twelve years ago a
group of Islamic terrorists attacked the United States killing almost 3,000
people and causing the collapse of the World Trade Center towers in New York
City. It was the end of an age of innocence for most Americans who, up until
that time, watched an angry world turned in on itself from the safety of a
television broadcast. Terrorist attacks were something that happened to other
people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The attack twelve
years ago was also an important entry for the United States into the
conversation about religion and violence. In the aftermath of September 11<sup>th</sup>,
hate crimes against Muslims and South Asians increased in this country. Muslim
Americans came forward to educate us all that the acts of a handful of
religious extremists do not speak for an entire faith group.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As Karen Armstrong
states, she has lost count of how many times she has “been informed
categorically that religion has been the cause of all the major wars in
history. In fact, the causes of conflict are usually greed, envy, and
ambition,” she says, “but in an effort to sanitize them, these self-serving
emotions have often been cloaked in religious rhetoric” (<i>Twelve Steps to a
Compassionate Life</i>, p. 4).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Even as the
military option against Syria seems to be off the table for now, it is still important
to understand the religious rhetoric that cloaks the conflict there. It can be
argued that the conflict in Syria is an inevitable re-balancing of power along
ethnic and religious lines. Most Syrians are Sunni Arabs, but the country is
run by members of a minority sect known as Alawites who are ethnic Arab and
follow a smaller branch of Islam. The borders in Syria are leftover from
European colonialism, which forced religious and ethnic groups into a cauldron
of potential conflict. Human greed, envy, ambition and distrust of the other
are attached to tribalism and sectarianism. It may look like religion is the
“bad guy” in Syria, but when we start to unravel the self-serving emotions,
including our own country’s self-serving emotions, the case to convict religion
becomes a bit more complicated. Even in Egypt, where both sides are now
invoking that the “right” interpretation of religion is on their side, it can
be concluded that political power is more at stake than religious loyalty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It isn’t just
religion as the cloak of war that has many blaming religion for the bulk of
what is wrong with our world. It is also “abstruse doctrinal definitions” and
downright refusal to accept modern science that has many naming religion as the
“bad guy.” In Texas, a measles outbreak was traced to a right-wing megachurch
whose pastor had preached against vaccines. Once the source of the outbreak was
located, it should be noted, the pastor cooperated with Texas Health Department
authorities, even offering to host vaccine clinics at her church. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This sounds like
something that could only happen in Texas, right? The Netherlands has been
experiencing a measles outbreak since May. The outbreak is expected to get
worse because it is rapidly spreading among unvaccinated orthodox Protestant
children. It is easy to blame all of religion as a superstitious,
violence-promoting, backward-thinking institution that halts humanity’s
progress. It is more challenging to unearth the compassionate voice of religion
that has always been there. Yet, this is the task that religious scholar Karen
Armstrong sets out to accomplish with The Charter for Compassion and her <i>Twelve
Steps to a Compassionate Life</i>. It is the task that we have taken on this
year as a people of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The first step is
“Learn About Compassion.” We start this task as students. We begin this year
with pencils sharpened and minds open wide to learn. We are asked to learn
“about the mythos that introduces us to the deeper meaning of compassion” (p.
27). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It is
developmentally appropriate to read a story to our children that implies that
if countries would only practice the Golden Rule there wouldn’t be any wars. As
adult students of compassion we are asked to move beyond a simplistic
application of the Golden Rule. We are asked to consider the complexity of
living compassionately in a world that makes religion the “bad guy” and
personal opinion an idol.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We are asked to
consider Thich Nhat Hahn’s “Recommendation,” a poem he wrote for his fellow
Buddhist workers in Vietnam on how to die nonviolently, without hatred. “The
only thing worthy of you is compassion,” he wrote, “invincible, limitless,
unconditional. Hatred will never let you face the beast in man.” Love becomes
eternal when we face this beast with compassion. Loving our enemy as they kill
us, is an embodiment of the Golden Rule that most of us, thankfully, will never
have to face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What is the mythos
that introduces us to the deeper meaning of compassion? What are the stories
that pull us down into the depths of life’s questions, past logic, past debate?
What are the timeless, universal truths that can teach us how to respond
compassionately? As we go through the twelve steps together this year we’ll
examine some of the traditional myths – the stories – that will take each of us
on our own hero’s journey into living compassionately. We do not need to ignore
the tribalism and the violence in both the Jewish and Christian scriptures. We
can learn that there is a long tradition in both Judaism and Christianity to
read those scriptures through an interpretive lens of history, experience and
allegory leading us to a deeper meaning of compassion. When we learn about the
mythos that introduces us to the deeper meaning of compassion here, we turn to
all the world’s religions and cultures, knowing that what forms a culture’s
collective knowledge and memory can also take us deeper into the truth of
compassionate living.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Karen Armstrong
wants us to begin this journey learning about the religious and philosophical
traditions that emerged during the Axial Age. She writes in the book that “From
about 900 to 200 BCE, during what the German philosopher Karl Jaspers called
the ‘Axial Age,’ there occurred a religious revolution that proved pivotal to
the spiritual development of humanity” (p. 31). Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism,
Confucianism, Daoism, monotheism in the Middle East and philosophical
rationalism in Greece all developed during this time. Armstrong’s thesis is
that we have never surpassed the insights of the Axial Age. It is time for us
to turn back towards the teachings of that time; it is time to turn back to the
teachings of compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The sages and the
teachers from this time period honored their own experience of the
transcendent, but didn’t necessarily give it a supernatural explanation. They
also honored the transcendent experience of the student, urging everyone to
test their teachings based on their own personal experience. Siddhartha Gautama
(The Buddha) said this, “Believe nothing just because a so-called wise person
said it. Believe nothing just because a belief is generally held. Believe
nothing just because it is said in ancient books. Believe nothing just because
it is said to be of divine origin. Believe nothing just because someone else
believes it. Believe only what you yourself test and judge to be true.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Before the Axial
Age, religion was about ritual and animal sacrifice. After the Axial Age, personal
transformation that translated into ethical action became central. Each
tradition developed its own version of the Golden Rule:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Hinduism: Maha<b>bhar</b>ata 5:15:17: Do naught unto
     others which would cause you pain if done to you.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Buddhism: Udana-Varga 5:18: Hurt not others in ways that
     you yourself would find hurtful.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Jainism:  &quot;Man should journey through life treating
     his fellow creatures as he would like to be treated.&quot;— Sutrakritanga
     1.11.33</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Confucianism: &quot;Try your best to treat others as you
     would wish to be treated yourself, and you will find that this is the
     shortest way to benevolence.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Daoism: &quot;Regard your neighbor's gain as your own
     gain, and your neighbor's loss as your own loss.&quot;</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Judaism: &quot;Love your neighbor as yourself; bear a
     grudge against no man. Whatever you hate, do to no man.&quot; — Leviticus
     19:18</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>“We should conduct ourselves toward others as we would
     have them act toward us.” — Aristotle</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>And so we should,
“conduct ourselves toward others as we would have them act toward us,” and yet
we don’t. We are addicted to an egotism embedded in the old brain. We are
limited by instincts that served our human and pre-human ancestors well. These
drives – identified by neuroscientists as the “Four Fs”: feeding, fighting,
fleeing, and…reproduction – keep us trapped in the “I.” The teachings of the
Axial Age, radical in the development of humankind, invite us to disappear the
“I” into a compassionate relationship with the other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The good news is
that along with the development of our instincts, the brain has been developing
more benevolent and altruistic emotions. As science continues to apprehend the
workings of our brain including the reptilian brain, the limbic system, the
Neocortex and the differences between our right and left brains, we can begin
to understand that empathy is possible and compassion is as much a part of our
brain development as the development of an ego focused simply on surviving.
Religion is the source of some wars and it is also the source of the Golden
Rule, the criterion of true faith.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Even in its most
simplistic application, applying the Golden Rule to the situation in Syria
makes bombing Syria out of the question as a religious response. We condemn the
use of chemical weapons.  Do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done
to you, the Hindu version of the Golden Rule tells us. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The Syrians have
clearly violated the Golden Rule. Responding with compassion, how is it that we
would bomb and kill the Syrians in response to their own killing? It is like
punishing a child who has hit a playmate or a sibling by hitting the offending
child. Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In the Jewish
tradition, during the High Holy Days which have just ended, Jews are called to
ask God and themselves to move from the throne of Punitive Justice to the
throne of Compassionate Repair. In recent remarks Pope Francis stated that,
“Never has the use of violence brought peace in its wake. War begets war,
violence begets violence.” The Rev. Peter Morales, President of the Unitarian
Universalist Association said this in response to the situation in Syria: “We
mourn the loss of life by all kinds of weapons. And we assert that the U.S.
government needs to exhaust all non-violent methods to bring about an end to
this conflict before resorting to military intervention.” This is religion at
its best: responding from a deep tradition that embraces the principle of
compassion. These are the compassionate voices of religion, voices that have
been speaking for thousands of years. Just yesterday American and Russian
diplomats reached an agreement that seems to have postponed a violent response
to Syria for now. It would be naïve to conclude that these religious voices of
compassion halted the use of force; it is more apparent that a diplomatic
solution became easier to reach after a threat of a violent response. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The first step of
the Armstrong’s book <i>Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life</i> is the most
academically dense. She advises that we read through the whole book first and
then return to it a second time to practice the steps. Learning about
compassion is not just an academic exercise; it is a spiritual one and first we
must prepare ourselves with expanding our knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It will take time
to unlearn our own judgments about religion as the “bad guy,” as the cause of
all the major wars in history. It will take time to unlearn the damage done to
ourselves and those we love by abstruse doctrinal definitions. It will take
time to learn that love can become eternal when we practice compassion in a
world that seems determined to self-destruct. This is the practice: when you
find yourself sitting across the table from someone telling you their story – a
story so far outside your own life experience – allow yourself to walk a holy
spiral that pulls you down into the depths of your being. This is the practice:
listen deeply to the story of the “other.” Listen deeply to this opportunity to
learn compassion, knowing that the only thing worthy of you is compassion. </p>
