<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While I was in seminary my mother developed the
habit of bringing up the most recent sermon she had heard at her church in order
to challenge my theology. Maybe it was because I called her every Sunday
afternoon and the sermon was fresh in her mind. Although, I think she actually
called me once in the middle of the week to tell me to listen to a sermon her
Episcopalian priest delivered for Easter. Apparently he had confessed to not
believing in the literal resurrection while he was in seminary; his sermon
centered on how that belief had changed for him. My mother called to tell me to
go to their web site and listen to the sermon and then she said, “Can you
imagine being in seminary and not believing that the resurrection actually
happened?” And then she giggled sheepishly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Of course my mother knew that I attended seminary
and I did not believe in the literal resurrection of Jesus Christ. At least I
think she knew what I believed. She really struggled with this during the last
few years of her life, which coincided with my time in seminary. I attempted to
help her to understand exactly what I believe. I gave her papers I had written,
suggested books for her to read, and taken her to a few worship services while
she was visiting from Houston. Once (I think it was after I admitted to her I
had never gone to the St. Dunstan’s web site and listened to the resurrection
sermon) I told her that if she really understood what I believed she wouldn’t
be worried about the state of my soul. Like the historical Universalists that
are represented in the name of my chosen faith, I believe that God’s love is
available to all, regardless of what religious belief they profess, so my soul
(just like everyone else’s) is fine, thank you very much. I think my mother used
to bring these issues up in our weekly conversations because she was actually
worried that I may be headed for eternal damnation. Maybe this was because she
had lived with cancer for eight years before she died; most of those years I
was in seminary. Perhaps she was afraid she would not see me in heaven and
wanted to do all she could before she died to make sure I will join her there
someday.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The only sermon I listened to from my mother’s
priest, the man who presided at her funeral, was preached on the Sunday in the
Christian calendar calls the Feast of the Epiphany and the Baptism of our Lord
Jesus Christ. I listened to the sermon because my mother was particularly taken
by the story the priest opened with from “A Prairie Home Companion,” which
seemed to disparage Unitarians. I did my usual inept job of explaining to my
mother what I found unacceptable in the sacrament of baptism and why we practice
child dedication instead. But, all she could say was that she was glad both her
grandchildren had been baptized prior to my family joining the First Unitarian
Church of Dallas. And so I listened to the sermon on baptism, curious as to how
exactly Unitarians had been depicted. I have to admit I may have also listened
in hopes of looking for more ammunition to better fight the war my mother was
waging on our living tradition.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In Garrison Keillor’s weekly “News from Lake
Wobegon” segment he told the story of one of the residents of Lake Wobegon who
had moved to St. Paul and joined a Unitarian church. Her Lutheran sister
visited for the “Affirmation of Personhood” ceremony for her niece and nephew
and was left wanting more. I have never heard of an “Affirmation of Personhood”
ceremony, and wonder if this was editorializing from Keillor or from my
mother’s priest. I am assuming the target of the sermonizing priest is the
child dedication ceremony that many of our churches celebrate. After
establishing the “wrongness” of the Unitarian practice, the priest launched
into the theme of his sermon: “the more” of Christian baptism. The priest
identified “the more” as a sort of “holy watermark” that can be seen by God.
Once baptized, the Christian has the name of Jesus on their side. Like Jesus at
his baptism, the Christian is named beloved by God and in this naming the
Christian is protected from evil. This is a direct quote from the sermon: “No
harm can ever come to you again because of the power and victory of the love
that Jesus shares with us in his name.” I find this remark to be completely
astonishing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I am appalled and angered that anyone in authority
could suggest that a ritual has the power to protect anyone, much less a young
child, from the “power of evil.” I am proud to be a part of a faith tradition
that offers no such guarantees. I am also proud to be a part of a faith
tradition that honors its Christian roots, just as I honor my own roots growing
up in the Episcopalian Church. I am not Unitarian Universalist because I
rejected my childhood faith based on the dogmatic interpretation of one priest.
I am a Unitarian Universalist because our tradition of the free pulpit and the
free pew allows me to interpret scripture, ritual and religion in an ongoing
dialogue with my faith community.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I have come to learn that as Unitarian Universalists
we welcome children into a church community acknowledging the fact that life
sometimes brings harm and pain, both good and evil. We do not need a magical
rite to protect us from harm; we need each other to find our way back to
wholeness when harm has been done. We do also need something outside ourselves;
we need the sort of grace that is available to all whether baptized or not. I
am grateful each day for the opportunity to surrender to a faith that does not
exclude someone from God’s love because they do not carry a certain “mark,”
received in an exclusive ritual.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Why am I a Unitarian Universalist? The answer to
this question changes as my faith matures and my journey takes me to new
places. I first became a UU more than thirteen years ago so my children had a
place to learn how to describe “transcending mystery and wonder” in their own
words. While I was in seminary the answer to that question changed as I placed
myself in a tug-of-war between my childhood faith and what I perceived as an
overabundance of the rational in my chosen faith.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Frustrated with the endless reading in seminary I
once complained to my minister that I wasn’t called to the ministry for the
constant intellectual barrage but that “I just wanted to sit with people and
hold their hand while they died.” I meant this in a larger sense, of course. I
didn’t expect my entire ministry to be about sitting with people who were
dying. I did think that ministry would be more about being with people than
about being with mountains of books, however. It was with a sense of irony,
then, that I read yet another required theological text the week I sat with my
mother who was dying at her home in Houston.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><i>Reason and Reverence</i> by William R. Murry is
one of the books I was required to read prior to my interview with the
Ministerial Fellowship Committee on my way to becoming a fellowshipped minister.
The book is Murry’s attempt to reconcile the humanist and the theist traditions
in Unitarian Universalism. He integrates religious humanism with religious
naturalism, which, in his words, “results in a greater spiritual depth and a
language of reverence, both of which many find missing in traditional religious
humanism” (from the introduction to the book).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I have been called a gentle theist, a deist and a
panentheist by colleagues and professors who have sought to define my theology.
If naming God as the ongoing act of creation itself identifies me as a theist,
then so be it. You could also label me a sort of humanist if you want to; I
start every theological inquiry with human experience not with a desire to
discover a supernatural God who intervenes in human history. I do know this
about myself: I do not want to give up on a language of reverence that points
to a larger reality. Murry’s thesis intrigued me, but what comfort could it
give me in the face of the stinging loss that I was experiencing?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Two days before my mother died, her Episcopalian
priest and a member of their congregation brought communion to the house. I
received communion with my mother and then participated in her anointing, a
ritual similar to the Roman Catholic last rites. Although I disagree with most
of the theology contained in these rituals, it was a deep honor to witness the
comfort these rituals gave my mother.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Religious humanism rejects ritual and ceremony. It
has also been rightly accused of relying on intellectual rationalism that seems
cold and unfeeling. Murry’s humanistic religious naturalism acknowledges the
role of emotions in determining how we live. Head and heart are balanced in his
approach. Reverence is achieved not by worshipping something outside of
ourselves, but by experiencing life in such a way as to become more fully
human.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Watching my mother receive communion, be anointed
with oil and repeat the Lord’s Prayer, I wondered what sort of ritual I would
want when I died. And then the priest and his parishioner said good-bye to my
mother. They told her they loved her and she told them she loved them in
return. “That’s the sort of ritual I would want,” I thought.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Two days later my two sisters and I watched my
mother die. She breathed us into this world. We were with her when she breathed
herself out. “Ritual enough for me,” I thought at the time. Looking back on
these events almost three years later, I begin to wonder if it is ritual enough
for me. Now that I am a full-time Unitarian Universalist minister, I wonder if
it is enough for us to be surrounded by those we love when we die. Or do we
need some acknowledgement of our chosen faith, some acknowledgment of the
comfort we get from our own religion?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It has been said that few will ask for the seven
principles to be read while they are on their deathbed. If there is no
proscribed ritual to be performed by an ordained elite, then what marks our
final passages as Unitarian Universalists? Is it comfort enough to know we have
lived well? Is it comfort enough to know that our religion, in some sense,
becomes final as we are drawing our very last breath?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the novelist D.H. Lawrence was subjected to the
sermons of his mother’s pastor he wrote, “A person has no religion who has not
slowly and painfully gathered one together, adding to it, shaping it; and one’s
religion is never complete and final, it seems, but must always be undergoing
modification.” Unitarian Universalist theologian Forrest Church, who defined
religion as our human response to the dual reality of being alive and having to
die, points out that Lawrence’s response to his mother’s pastor underlines our
unique approach to religion. Rather than a “subscription to some fixed
combination of doctrine and practice,” Unitarian Universalism offers a “gradual
process of awakening to the depths and possibilities of life itself.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When my parents remodeled their home after the last
of us left the nest, they took over what used to be my bedroom on the second
floor and turned it into a study. One wall was covered from about waist-level
up with cork board so they could post maps with pins in them to indicate all of
the places they had traveled. The cork board was also good for posting photos
and certificates of accomplishment like my mother’s visit to Machu Picchu. A
few weeks before my mother died, I stood in what was once my bedroom, staring
at the wall of my mother’s travels. Posted next to the certificate indicating
she saw the “Big Five” in Africa was another certificate, a proclamation:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“By this attestation be it known that Jeanne Brandis
by virtue of fulfilling the biblical injunction has ascended to Jerusalem the
holy city, capital of Israel, and is henceforth authorized to bear the title of
Jerusalem pilgrim.” My eye was drawn to that particular certificate because I
had just returned from my own Unitarian Universalist “pilgrimage” to Boston. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I went to Boston in my final year of seminary
expecting some great illumination from this living tradition to brighten my
path. The pilgrimage became about something else of course, because that’s what
true pilgrimages do. We set out expecting to find all that is holy from a place
and discover that trips are just trips, pilgrimages happen when we least expect
them to. The more important pilgrimage may have come while I was standing in
the room where I lived as a teenager, remembering what the room used to look
like, remembering who I was when I lived in that room, remembering that nothing
in this life is permanent. Standing in that room not knowing that the most
important pilgrimage was about to happen in a few weeks: it would happen while
I was reading a book on religious humanism with my mother dying in the next
room.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“By this attestation be it known that Lora Brandis
by virtue of fulfilling Life’s injunction has ascended to the holy city,
capital of the soul, and is henceforth authorized to bear the title of pilgrim.”*
But wait, there’s an asterisk on my certificate and some fine print to be read.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>*May it also be known that the recipient of this
certificate agrees that by bearing the title pilgrim that said recipient
acknowledges that in no way is bearer done with all pilgrimages. In fact the
holy city the pilgrim visited may be subject to moving, re-defining or
disappearing altogether. As such, the bearer of this certificate agrees to hold
harmless all parties involved in the pilgrimage, including the self and any or
all parties previously identified as God.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I am a Unitarian Universalist because I am a pilgrim
and Unitarian Universalists are a pilgrim people. It is my honor to journey
with you.</p>
