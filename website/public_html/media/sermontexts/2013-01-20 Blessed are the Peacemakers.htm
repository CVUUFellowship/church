<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>At our Unitarian Universalist Association’s General
Assembly in June of 2012 the seeds of an idea were planted. You have heard a lot
about our General Assembly (GA) from last summer. You have heard that we
declared it as a Justice GA in order to address the fact that we would be
gathering as a faith in Phoenix, in a state that many were boycotting because
of inhumane immigration laws. If you are new to our faith, or are visiting, you
may not have heard that Unitarian Universalists did not join in the boycott of
the state. Instead, we attended our annual gathering in an intentional way – a
way meant to stand on the side of love with our brothers and sisters doing the
work of peace and justice in Arizona. We went to Phoenix, nineteen of us from
this congregation, to stand as allies for immigration justice. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>For most of us, the primary social witness event was a
candlelight vigil held the night of June 23 outside Maricopa County’s “Tent
City” jail, where County Sheriff Joe Arpaio keeps prisoners outdoors in tents
without air conditioning. On June 23, the high temperature in Phoenix was
109°F. About 2400 Unitarian Universalists loaded up on buses that took us from
the downtown convention center to the jail site where we sang, chanted and held
up battery-powered candles for a two-hour vigil. We listened to speeches from
our leaders and interfaith partners who had just come from a tour of Tent City.
Puente Arizona organizer Carlos Garcia thanked UUs for bringing national
attention to the conditions at the jail. The Rev. Dr. William F. Schulz,
president of the UU Service Committee and former executive director of Amnesty
International USA read the list of 122 people who had died in detention in the
U.S. between 2003 and 2011 without having been convicted of a crime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We returned to our buses, walking past counter-protestors,
some carrying firearms (legal in the state of Arizona). We also walked past
local protestors who thanked us for our presence. We returned our
battery-operated candles and placed our empty water bottles in trash bags.
Sitting together on the quiet bus ride back to the convention center, the seed
of an idea had been planted. We wondered what that idea would look like as it
started to grow when we returned to our home congregations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The idea of immigration justice has followed us home in our
efforts to begin a detainee visitation program in collaboration with our
interfaith partners in Ventura County. Immigration justice is one branch of the
idea beginning to grow from the seed planted in the Phoenix heat. The idea is
larger than immigration justice. It contains justice for those in our country
without documents, but the idea that now drives many of us that attended
Justice GA is larger, more staggering. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The revolution that followed us home is an emerging
awareness that, in the words of Michelle Alexander, “We have allowed ourselves
to be willfully blind to the emergence of a new caste system” (<i>The New Jim
Crow).</i> Phoenix taught us that Joe Arpaio’s Tent City is not just a symbol
of our broken immigration system. Tent City is a symbol of a new era – what
Alexander identifies as “The New Jim Crow.” The mass incarceration of poor
people of color in this country is a new caste system. It is the moral
equivalent of Jim Crow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Cornell West calls Michelle Alexander’s book, <i>The New
Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,</i> “a genuine
resurrection of the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr. amid the confusion of the
Age of Obama” (from the preface). Alexander, a law professor, civil rights
advocate and writer, had her eyes first opened to the emergence of a new caste
system while she was helping former inmates re-enter into a society that, in
her estimation, didn’t have much use for them in the first place. The trumped
up “War on Drugs,” the increasing power of the prison-industrial complex and numerous
government policies have created a system of discrimination that is similar to
the Jim Crow laws put in place by a racist society responding to the end of
slavery.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In her introduction to the book Alexander tells the story
of Jarvious Cotton who, like his father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and
great-great-grandfather had been denied the right to vote. She writes,
“Cotton’s great-great-grandfather could not vote as a slave. His
great-grandfather was beaten to death by the Ku Klux Klan for attempting to
vote. His grandfather was prevented from voting by Klan intimidation. His
father was barred from voting by poll taxes and literacy tests. Today, Jarvious
Cotton cannot vote because he, like many black men in the United States, has
been labeled a felon and is currently on parole” (page 1). The same core belief
that created slavery and Jim Crow has created the new racial caste system: the
belief that some members of our society are not worthy of the common care and
compassion afforded to most.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Alexander’s astonishing and persuasive thesis is not the
one we are used to, the one those of us of privilege can nod our heads to and
say “oh yes, but things are so much better now that we’ve elected a black man
as our president.” Yes, poor communities of color are burdened with crime and
rising incarceration rates. Of course this is due to the very function of
poverty and lack of access to quality of education. Alexander is not
reiterating this idea. What she is proposing will lift the scales from our
eyes. The War on Drugs is the New Jim Crow. Undocumented migrants lost in
detention are the New Jim Crow. “Zero tolerance” policies in schools are the New
Jim Crow. Three Strikes Laws are the New Jim Crow. Mass incarceration is,
metaphorically, the New Jim Crow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>According to Alexander, “By the turn of the twentieth
century, every state in the South had laws on the books that disenfranchised
blacks and discriminated against them in virtually every sphere of life,
lending sanction to a racial ostracism that extended to schools, churches,
housing, jobs, restrooms, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, orphanages, prisons,
funeral homes, morgues, and cemeteries. Politicians competed with each other by
proposing and passing ever more stringent, oppressive, and downright ridiculous
legislation (such as laws specifically prohibiting blacks and whites from
playing chess together)…. The new racial order, known as Jim Crow – a term
apparently derived from a minstrel show character – was regarded as the ‘final
settlement,’ the ‘return to sanity,’ and ‘the permanent system’” (p. 34). The
system started unraveling when the Supreme Court declared state-sponsored
school segregation unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The
remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the
Voting Rights Act of 1965.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Before either of these was enacted, on April 16, 1963,
Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote a letter from the Birmingham Jail. He wrote in
response to eight of his colleagues who had published a statement in the local
newspaper calling his recent nonviolent protests “unwise and untimely.” He started
his letter by writing on the margins of the newspaper. It is a lengthy letter.
When he ran out of room in the newspaper margins he continued writing on paper
supplied by someone he identifies as a “friendly Negro trusty” and then
concluded on a pad of paper his attorneys were finally permitted to leave him.
The Letter From Birmingham Jail contains King’s famous quote: “Injustice
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In his long letter King schools his fellow clergymen on the
difference between the two types of laws: just and unjust. He quotes St.
Augustine saying that “an unjust law is no law at all.” “Any law that uplifts
human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust,”
King wrote almost fifty years ago from jail. As segregation statutes robbed
blacks of their inherent worth and dignity then, unjust laws now condemn one in
three young African American men to time in prison (<i>The New Jim Crow</i>, p.
9). Segregation gave the oppressor a false sense of superiority over the “other.”
Today’s mass incarceration perpetuates the same false sense of superiority. We
have King’s words again echoing from the past to help us navigate from the
present into a better future: “Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust
in its application.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Several months ago this congregation started writing to
prisoners in solitary confinement, to men held at the Pelican Bay State Prison
in SHU – the Security Housing Unit. Outreach Director Maria Ornelas and several
volunteers meet each Sunday after the second service and write to a list of
inmates provided by Virginia Classick, a local representative of the National
Religious Campaign Against Torture. Virginia advised us to include a note from
me on letterhead to accompany the volunteers’ correspondence. My cover letter
would include how we obtained their name, a bit about our church and, because
it was on letterhead our return address if the men wanted to write back:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:150%'><span
style='color:black'>This card is being sent to you by a member of Conejo Valley
Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, where I serve as the minister. Here we
nurture spiritually courageous people who transform the world through justice
and compassion. A member of California Families to Abolish Solitary Confinement
provided us with your name and address. Your first name was attached to a card
so that a member of our congregation could address and think of you by name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:150%'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:150%'><span
style='color:black'>As Unitarian Universalists we affirm the inherent worth and
dignity of every person. At the national level we have been involved in the
campaign to end prolonged solitary confinement. In fact, the board president of
the National Religious Campaign Against Torture is a Unitarian Universalist.
Locally we work with the UU Legislative Ministry of California to enact just
laws that affect human rights issues. </span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:150%'><span

interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part. We know that what
affects one, affects us all.</span></p>

strength for your journey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Thinking of my letter as just a cover letter, I never
expected to receive correspondence back from the men our volunteers were
sending more personalized notes to. I was surprised by letters addressed to me,
directly in response to what I had said in what I had thought of as “just a
form letter.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The men I have heard from would like the entire
congregation to know their gratitude. One wrote that he likes that we recognize
the web of all existence – it is something he has come to realize along what he
calls his rather “thorny” journey. One has been in solitary since he was
fourteen years old, with “no end in sight.” One stated that his beliefs are
similar to the Fellowship’s, adding that he’s not a religious person. Another,
who has been in solitary for more than 26 years, wrote about his involvement in
peaceful activism fighting for prison reform.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Virginia Classick received the following email expressing
gratitude for our participation in this project. “This week I received from my
loved one in Pelican Bay SHU a copy of the Conejo Valley Unitarian Universalist
Fellowship letter from Minister Rev. Lora Brandis and two cards from her
parishioners. He forwarded these to me, writing:  ‘nice of this church to send
inmates in SHU X-mas cards on holidays. We need to also get churches here in CC
community on our side.’ Thank you so much for this beautiful program. The cards
from Anne and Tricia were lovely, perfectly written, and the church cover
letter gets to the point exactly: That each person has worth and dignity, and that
we are all interconnected and therefore responsible for human rights.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Fifty years ago Martin Luther King, Jr. sat in a jail cell
writing about just and unjust laws and just laws that became unjust upon
application. He wrote to his fellow clergymen and to all who told his race to
wait, to a group he rightly accused of being “more devoted to ‘order’ than to
justice; who prefer[s] a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a
positive peace which is the presence of justice.” “True peace is not the
absence of conflict…but the presence of justice.” He wrote to put an end to
racial discrimination codified by a Jim Crow South. His spirit can live again
when we allow ourselves to see the absence of justice in a system of mass
incarceration that locks up and locks away the generations King fought to free.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will know themselves
and all others as children of God. Blessed are the letter writers, for their
words will raise hope in the human heart. Blessed are those who are in prison,
for they will lead us all to freedom. Blessed are the positive-peacemakers, for
they truly know that “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” </span></p>
