<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It finally happened: someone asked me if my church
believes in heaven. I did my awkward best to answer. Some of us do, some of us
don’t. It’s really not fair to ask what the church believes; we have to ask
first what each person believes. We’re non-creedal and covenantal. It’s not
about what we believe; it’s how we behave with each other that matters. After
listening patiently as I fumbled along, my questioner finally said, “Well, my
church believes in heaven and it matters how we behave with each other too.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And then she described to me exactly what she loved
about her church: how they took care of each other when one of them was sick,
how they greeted each other every Sunday with a hug, how they divided up into
smaller groups so they could get to know each other more intimately. Sound
familiar? Maybe our beliefs don’t separate us from other religions as much as
we think they do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>My questioner asked me about heaven. She didn’t ask
me about what we believed about immigration as a moral issue or marriage
equality. Just because we didn’t discuss either of those two issues, I cannot
assume she and I would hold different beliefs when it comes to immigration
reform or the right of same-sex couples to marry. I did not tell her about our
Standing on the Side of Love Campaign, how the immigration reform proponents in
Arizona think of us as the “love people.” I did not tell her that my church
stood on the corner and held signs questioning the 1% and arguing against
California’s Proposition 8. She had asked me if we believe in heaven. This
belief is what mattered to her. This belief is what she thought might separate
her church from mine. In the end, I listened to how she loves her church and
hoped she could tell how much I love mine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Last Saturday I met a man at Ventura County Pride
who told me what he loves about his church. He belongs to a small Christian
church with about 50 members. He was proud to share that they call him their
“token” – the church’s only gay member. He is a cancer survivor with a
miraculous story of leaving hospice to outlive all of his doctors’ predictions.
When he left hospice, he was told he would be going to a rehab center to get
used to the new hip that had replaced his cancer-ridden bone. Members of the
church picked him up and took him not to a rehab center, but to a room in
someone’s home that they had equipped for him so that members of the church
could care for him around the clock. His church’s denomination is currently
embroiled in a debate about ordaining gays and lesbians, so of course there is
a wide range of beliefs in his church. What he loves about his church is how
they move beyond belief to love the stranger, caring for him beyond belief,
loving the stranger that he once was into wholeness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Gail Geisenhainer was evangelized beyond belief into
Unitarian Universalism. She now serves as the minister of the First Unitarian
Universalist Congregation in Ann Arbor. I am told that she once served our
nearby congregation in Canoga Park. I am also told that when she said, “All
blank-ing churches are the same….” “They say they’re open—but they don’t want
queer folk. To heck with church!” that her words were probably a bit stronger
than she’ll admit in an article published in the <i>UU World</i> magazine.  She
does, however, admit to carrying a rock-hard chip on her shoulder from every
other religious experience she had ever had. Ever.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The gray-haired ladies of the Maine UU church had a
surprise for Gail. They offered her coffee. They loved her beyond belief into
wholeness. She stayed for coffee and for Unitarian Universalism. Isn’t this a
great example of Unitarian Universalists being the “love people?” Aren’t we
proud of how we are so welcoming, how what we believe really does matter? And
how what we believe affects how we behave? Of course we are proud to call
ourselves Unitarian Universalists, to know we are connected by a set of values
and encouraged to explore many paths to the holy. This morning’s reading ends
with Gail being loved beyond belief into wholeness. The rest of the story goes
like this….</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This was the mid-1980s and during the Joys and
Concerns one Sunday a woman spoke, and this is a direct quote from Gail, “a
woman stood during Joys and Concerns to announce that all homosexuals had AIDS;
all homosexuals were deviants who could not be trusted with children, public
health, or civil society. All homosexuals should be quarantined, packed off to
work camps to provide useful labor for society and keep their filthy lifestyle
and deadly diseases to themselves” (<i>UU World</i>, Fall 2012, p. 14). The
shine fell off the new penny. Gail’s rock-hard chip on her shoulder started
reappearing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Most of us come to a church, a congregation, this
Fellowship wanting community. We want to be loved beyond belief into a
wholeness that we don’t even know we are seeking. We come here seeking, not
believing. We come here and when we find like-minded folks, speaking a language
that is somehow familiar to us, we feel comfortable. Some of us feel
comfortable for the first time in our lives. And we stay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Then someone says something, behaves in a way that
we disagree with, shares something in joys and sorrows that hurts us to our
core and now the true test of community begins. We are no longer comfortable
and all we want to do is leave. We didn’t know that when we were seeking
community that we would find a religious community.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Another one of my colleagues, Erik Walker Wikstrom, writes
that “At their best, churches can be – perhaps should be – a kind of spiritual
total immersion environment…. From the pastoral prayer to the passage of a
policy it’s all a school of the soul.” This is reminiscent of one of the most famous
quotes by the 20<sup>th</sup> Century Unitarian theologian James Luther Adams:
“Church is a place where you get to practice what it means to be human.” This
is the difference between community and community modified by the word
religion: we enter this community intentionally. We enter this community
expecting to be changed by it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When most of us think of intentional spiritual
communities, we think monastery or ashram. Those of us who are birthright
Unitarian Universalists or have chosen this as our faith rarely think of the
congregation we have joined as an intentional spiritual community. We are not
stepping off the world for quiet contemplation. Most religious traditions
acknowledge that all of life offers us an opportunity to deepen and to grow. Joining
an intentional community or visiting one for a retreat is not simply about
spending hours in prayer and meditation. The monastery offers the monk work to
be done in a prayerful manner; the ashram offers seva, selfless service to the
community. Quiet contemplation is only one way to connect with spirit. Work
done intentionally can bear the same fruit as other spiritual practices.  But
it is work and sometimes it is hard.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When Erik Wikstrom writes that, “It makes sense to
see church leadership as a spiritual practice because church leadership is
hard” he is talking to each and every one of us. “But I’m not a leader,” you
may be sitting there thinking. Ours is a tradition that affirms the “priesthood
and prophethood” of all believers. Some are called to a ministry of
transformational healing; others are called to a ministry of prophetic social
justice. We are all called: believers and non-believers alike. We are all
called to stay when leaving would be easier.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When Gail Geisenhainer was confronted with what we
might call a non-believer from the vantage point of proudly referring to
ourselves as the “love people,” she had a choice to make. When Gail heard
anti-gay remarks in a church she had been told would be different, she could
return the next week or she could add the experience to the rock-hard chip on
her shoulder and leave religion once and for all. She chose to confront her
discomfort, to face her pain and travel the harder path. She went back to
church.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There she found people willing to stand up during
Joys and Concerns and say that not everything said the week before was how
everyone believed. Furthermore, the congregation did not shun the “non-believer,”
the woman who had spoken so harshly during Joys and Concerns. After all, it’s
not about what we believe but how we behave with each other that matters.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Asking what the church believes or does not believe
falls into the theological category called ecclesiology from the Greek word <i>ekklesia</i>,
meaning called together. Ecclesiology is the study of what it means to be a
religious community. In the Christian community, the church is defined as the
body of Christ. The marks of the Christian community are the sacraments and
rituals, signifying the community’s relationship to each other and to all of
Christianity. Christians participate in these rituals and sacraments, receiving
grace in order to be of service to each other and to the world. In the Buddhist
tradition, there are the three treasures: the Buddha, the Dharma and the
Sangha. Sangha is the Pali and Sanskrit word for community. It most often
refers to the community of monastics, ordained monks and nuns. In Western
Buddhism Sangha refers to lay practitioners as well.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is difficult to identify the marks of Unitarian
Universalism. We don’t have readily identified rituals. We don’t even a common
language. I liken this to a “branding” issue, to use marketing lingo. When you
visit any 7-11 you know where you can find the toothpaste. It’s on the same
aisle in every 7-11 convenience store. This is marketing by design. This is
marketing that creates return visitors. When you visit a Unitarian Universalist
church you may not even be visiting a church. You may be visiting a Fellowship
or a Society. You may or may not hear the same opening affirmation, found as
#471 in <i>Singing the Living Tradition</i>.  You may or may not hear the same
closing words, found as #456. When someone asks us whether or not we believe in
heaven, we had better be prepared to welcome them on Sunday morning to an
unfamiliar experience with the familiar marks of a religious community. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>So what then does it mean each Sunday when many
Unitarian Universalists do recite #471 covenanting together that, “Love is the
doctrine of this church, the quest of truth its sacrament…” This traditional
affirmation, dating back to the 1930s Unitarian side of our tradition is said
in enough of our congregations that it could be identified as one of the marks
of our religion. I learned from my minister, the Rev. Dr. Laurel Hallman, that
the inclusion of this phrase in our covenants and in our readings signifies
that the spoken word is the sacrament of our worship services. If the quest of
truth is a sacrament – an outward sign of an inner searching – then the sermon
and all of the words uttered in the worship service proclaim some piece of that
quest. The “word” creates insight, transformation and ultimately, access to
grace. This invitation to be transformed by the spoken word is one of the
identifying marks of Unitarian Universalism, whether we call ourselves a
church, a Fellowship, a congregation or a Society.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are many member churches of the Unitarian
Universalist Association that do not affirm each Sunday that the quest of truth
is their sacrament. This independence is the foundation of our congregational
polity. Not only does each church create their own covenant, but each individual
is encouraged to form their own theology. Remembering what I awkwardly said to
the questioner who wanted to know if my church believes in heaven: “It’s really
not fair to ask what the church believes; we have to ask first what each person
believes.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>After we have asked what each person believes, we
move beyond belief into experience. What does each person experience Sunday
mornings in worship, Tuesday evenings in committee meetings and all during the
week in our covenant groups? Answering this question, we can begin to discover
how to move the conversation beyond belief into, “How do Unitarian
Universalists live as religious people?”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>From Fellowship to society, from church to
congregation there are identifying marks of how Unitarian Universalists live as
a religious community. These marks connect us to Unitarian Universalism and
they connect us to a way of being that spiritual, intentional religious
communities have been practicing for thousands of years. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>We value regular attendance at worship. Here is where we are
transformed and experience the spoken word as a sacred event.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>We attend regular meetings of the congregation and vote. We
practice discernment, discovering the needs of the whole rather than
privileging the needs of the individual.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>We make financial contributions to the work of the congregation
and to the wider community. We learn that charitable giving changes our own
lives, as well as the lives of others.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>We contribute our time and talent. We give back from the depths
of our own soul, not because of obligation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>We are intentional about our own spiritual growth and
development. The missions of our churches, fellowships, societies and
congregations directly reflect this commitment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The woman who believes in heaven and I have a lot in
common. We both love our church, these schools of the soul. We both love having
a place to go where we get to practice what it means to be human.</p>
