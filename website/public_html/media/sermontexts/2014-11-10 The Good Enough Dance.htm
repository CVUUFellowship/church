<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Preached at the Conejo
Valley Unitarian Universalist Fellowship </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>November 10, 2013</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Several years ago
two co-workers and I traveled from Dallas to Austin for an arts conference
hosted by the Texas Commission on the Arts. The proposal for our small ethnic
dance company to be included in the touring roster of Texas artists had been
accepted and our ballet folklorico troupe had been invited to perform.
Attending this conference was to be our reward for all of the hard work that
had gone into preparing the proposal, which included extensive research on the
costs of touring, something our small company had never done. This was the
first step to being accepted on a larger artists’ roster created by the
National Endowment for the Arts that paid for tours throughout the Southwest
and the Midwest. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As the development
director of the organization, I was used to writing grant proposals and
speaking to potential funders to prove that our organization was “good enough”
to receive support. It was tough for our tiny company to be able to afford the
trip to Austin. We had been through a lot together, including the threat of
having to dissolve our organization due to the lack of funds. All of us needed
this reward. All of us needed to be reminded that we were good enough to stay
in business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Choreographer,
performer, writer, and educator Liz Lerman was the keynote speaker for the
conference. She spoke, she taught workshops and on the final day of the
conference she created a community dance with all those in attendance, arts
administrators and dancers alike. Of her own career Lerman, now in her sixties,
says this, “I received critical acclaim and critical bruising. I got awards
from the National Endowment for the Arts, from universities, from journals and
newspapers and cultural institutions and a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant.
I also received more rejections than I can count or list or remember.” </p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So when I stood up
to make a contribution to the community dance all those years ago at the Texas
Commission on the Arts spring conference, Lerman must have known what I meant
by saying, “those of us in the arts always struggle with being good enough.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>All of us struggle
with being good enough, of course. In his book, <i>The Examined Life: How We
Lose and Find Ourselves</i>, psychoanalyst and University College London
professor Stephen Grosz points out that lavishing praise on a child does not
lead to greater self-esteem. He cites recent research when he notes that “Often
a child will react to praise by quitting – why make a new drawing if you have
already made ‘the best’? Or a child may simply repeat the same work – why draw
something new, or in a new way, if the old way always gets applause?” Why does
one generation of parents over praise their children? Probably to make up for
the extreme opposite styles of their own parents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Those who were
brought up without acknowledgement of any kind want to raise their children
differently than they were raised, but this doesn’t work either according to
Grosz. “In trying so hard to be different from our parents, we’re actually
doing much the same thing – doling out empty praise the way an earlier
generation doled out thoughtless criticism.” How do we teach self-esteem and
how do we recover our lost self-esteem? By being present, Grosz says. All that
is needed to recover a sense of “good enough” is to be present to our own
inherent worth and dignity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The religious
response to “good enough” is found in our first principle. As Unitarian
Universalists we affirm the inherent worth and dignity of every person,
including ourselves. The religious response to good enough is also found in one
of Jesus’ sayings about the lilies of the field, a saying captured by UU
minister Lynn Ungar in her poem “Camas Lilies.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><i>Even now, unneeded and uneaten,</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><i>the camas lilies gaze out above
the grass</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>from their tender blue eyes.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Even in sleep your life will shine.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Make no mistake. Of course</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>your work will always matter.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>Yet Solomon in all his glory</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>was not arrayed like one of these.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Of course your
work will always matter, but your work does not prove your worth. Your work
isn’t the proof you need to declare that you are finally good enough. Praise
you receive for your work can be a trap causing you to be less creative and to
take less risk. Declare yourself good enough now and the praise won’t matter;
only the work will matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I am in my fourth
year as a minister and in my third year as your minister, having been called to
the ministry after a career in nonprofit management including as development
director of Dallas’ Anita N. Martinez Ballet Folklorico. It took me seven years
to finish seminary – a process that included scrutiny by faculty, a career
assessment led by a psychologist and the approval of two different bodies of
the Unitarian Universalist Association. I answered questions, I read hundreds
of books and I proved my competency in fifteen different areas including
theology, world religions, human development and administration. I know a
little bit about good enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>So in January when
I participated in a retreat with the board and the council I recognized a
familiar drum beat. I heard the rhythm of the <u>not</u> good enough dance
starting to play. Each group of the council was asked to tie its goals for the
year to the long range plan. That means the board, the minister, the director
of religious education, operations, outreach, membership and communications all
need to clearly state what it is they hope to accomplish for the year. As
people stood to make their contribution to the goals for the year, I began to
hear the drum beat of “not enough time, not enough money, not enough people,
not enough…not enough…not enough.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We live in a
perfectionistic culture that causes us to respond to “not enough” with over
functioning and over compensating. When the work doesn’t get done exactly the
way we think it should get done, we step in and do it ourselves. Taking over
and correcting someone’s efforts is just as damaging to their self-esteem as
offering hollow praise. </p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As your minister, I
have discovered that the perfectionistic culture here mirrors my own need to
prove that I am good enough. I am humbled by the opportunity to remind us all
that whether we hang on to these buildings or have to reduce staff that somehow
we are all &quot;good enough&quot; - that our shared ministry right now is
exactly the ministry that is needed. And as we appreciate who we are as a
congregation, amazingly pledges are increasing and worst-case scenarios are
quickly fading out of the realm of possibility. Have you noticed that as we declare
ourselves as generous, we become generous? As we declare ourselves as good
enough, we become good enough. Our work will always matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Another religious
response to “good enough” can be found in the Tao Te Ching, best explained to
the Western mind in Benjamin Hoff’s classic <i>The Tao of Pooh</i>. When Hoff
recounts the Chinese fable of the stonecutter who doesn’t recognize his own
value, it is the famous English bear Winnie-the-Pooh that best illustrates what
the story means. Pooh, the bear of very little brain, has a way of noticing the
value in everyday life. Pooh can always see what is right in front of him. He
knows this secret: “Tao does not do, but nothing is not done.” Winnie-the-Pooh
knows the secret of good enough: “The Wise are Who They Are. They work with
what they’ve got and do what they can do” (Hoff p. 64). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We are all good
enough because nothing is wrong. This doesn’t mean that we lavish praise on our
children, telling them that their tree is the best art we’ve ever seen. It also
doesn’t mean that we point out everything that’s wrong with their tree. It
simply means that we notice that the tree is green. As Stephen Grosz reminds
us, “why draw something new, or in a new way, if the old way always gets
applause?” Being present is hard. Being present requires vulnerability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I am at my most
vulnerable when I stand in the pulpit. It has become a bit of a joke that more
than one person will come up to me after the worship service and say, &quot;You
really hit that one out of the park!&quot; or &quot;Another homerun!&quot; I
have mentioned this often enough that some of you are becoming self-conscious. One
Sunday one member, looking for another way to say that said, &quot;put a gold
star on that one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I’ve mentioned
these comments enough now that I’m afraid many of you are becoming
uncomfortable with that awkward moment as you walk in a line past me as I stand
in the vestibule. I do appreciate the praise and I’d like to invite you into
something more. If it means that all you say is “good morning” or “thank you,”
that will be enough. It will be good enough, in fact. You could say, “There is
a lot of blue in your picture,” and I will know what you mean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It is enough to
stand here and look at your faces. It is enough to hear your response in the
stunned silences after some services. It is enough to see how you respond to
the words in a hymn when we have to walk through yet another Sunday together
struggling to make sense of the latest act of senseless violence in our world.
I am at my most vulnerable in the pulpit because you are at your most
vulnerable when you show up in this Sanctuary on a Sunday morning. This is not
a performance. I do not need your applause. I need your presence because the
work we do together matters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The “good enough”
dance I participated in all those years ago at the arts conference wasn’t a
performance either. It wasn’t even a “good enough” dance. It had a lot more in
it than just good enough. Participants shared what the conference had meant to
them, what they had learned, what they would be carrying home with them. As
they talked, they gestured, their weight shifted, they moved naturally in a
dance that arose out of what was right in front of them. Words became gestures
and gestures became choreography in a community dance not meant for the stage. “Good
enough” became a movement of the hands to signify the quotation remarks around
the phrase. The movement ended with the hands resting, crossed over our hearts.
For weeks the three of us who had gone to Austin to be reminded that we were
“good enough” to keep our organization afloat would spontaneously break into
the dance, small movements to remind us of time spent with other struggling
humans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It’s been more
than fifteen years. All I remember is the “good enough” part of the dance. And
that’s, well…good enough. </p>
