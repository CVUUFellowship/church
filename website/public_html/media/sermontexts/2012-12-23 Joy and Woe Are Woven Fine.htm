style='color:black'>--William Blake, from Auguries of Innocence</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This week I received a phone call from a reporter asking if
I would be addressing the Connecticut tragedy in my Christmas message. The reporter
was interviewing local clergy and, having grown up a Unitarian Universalist,
she was eager to include our approach to the tragedy during what is supposed to
be “a joyful time of year.” She was aware that most clergy had immediately
addressed the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut
last week, three days after it had occurred. What she wanted to know was will
we continue to address the tragedy at a time of year when people are “supposed
to be happy?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I reminded her that Unitarian Universalists always worship
within the context of how the world is now. I assured her that even without
specifically referring to the Connecticut tragedy that it would be on our minds
as we looked to this time of year not as a time when we are “supposed to be
happy,” but as a time that we acknowledge the ancient wisdom in the symbol of
light shining in the darkness, and the darkness does not overcome it. This is
the time of year when the world turns from the darkness of the longest night to
more light in the lengthening of each day. This turning from darkness to light,
and back again, each year is not a choice. It is the way things are. We come to
this “joyful” time of year with William Blake’s understanding that “joy and woe
are woven fine.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Joy and woe are woven fine – these words come to me this
time of year as I imagine sitting with my own family around the Christmas
table. They came to me again when the reporter asked me how we make sense of
senseless tragedy. These words surface in my consciousness often, when I visit
with someone in the hospital, dedicate a child to a church community, officiate
at a wedding or allow the love of a community to wash through me as I lead a
memorial service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We know that joy and woe are woven fine because every Sunday
we share joys and sorrows with each other. We write in a book and share our
joys and sorrows out loud. We drop a stone in the water, watching the ripples,
knowing that what affects one affects us all. We drop one last stone for all
that is left unsaid, for the joys and sorrows we carry in our hearts and in our
minds, in the depths of our beings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“How do we make sense of this?” the reporter wanted to
know. “Why does suffering happen,” we all want to know. The theological term
for this is theodicy: “How can an all-powerful, supposedly loving God, allow
suffering? Allow evil?” Eastern Orthodox theologian and author David Bentley
Hart examines the Christian response to extreme suffering and loss in his book <i>The
Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami?</i> Hart rejects what he labels
as a “rational theodicy” that sees everything as a part of the divine plan.
When recalling an interview he read about a Sri Lankan man who failed to save
four of his five children in the tsunami, Hart writes, “Only a moral cretin at
that moment would have attempted to soothe his anguish by assuring him that his
children had died as a result of God’s eternal, inscrutable, and righteous
counsels, and that in fact their deaths had mysteriously served God’s purposes
in history, and that all of this was completely necessary for God to accomplish
his ultimate design in having created this world” (p. 99). Hart is offering a
harsh assessment of the sort of shallow theology we have been hearing a lot of
lately in the aftermath of the Newtown tragedy. Many of us may have to sit with
the shallow theology of our friends and relatives at a holiday meal in the next
few days. It may be uncomfortable to call Uncle Fred a moral cretin, but it may
also be unconscionable to remain silent. We pride ourselves on being a religion
that embraces freedom, reason and tolerance. These dark days have taught me
that tolerating bad theology may be worse than intolerance itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>There are alternative theologies. In <i>Omnipotence and
other Theological Mistakes</i> philosopher and Unitarian Universalist Charles
Hartshorne replaced the understanding of God as unchangeable and all powerful
with the idea of God as relational and all loving. God does not cause our
suffering, but joins us in our suffering and is affected by it. Former
president of the UUA, Rev. John Buehrens, says this about suffering: “Job marks
a beginning in the Hebrew tradition – a reluctant one – in acknowledging that
some suffering comes for no good reason at all. It just happens, impersonally.
It comes out of the whirlwind, as part of the nature of things” (<i>Understanding
the Bible: An Introduction for Skeptics, Seekers, and Religious Liberals</i> p.
106). Religious humanism looks to a human being with inherent dignity and
worth, who is also capable of evil. The alternative to a shallow, rational
theodicy is an understanding that we co-create this world. When suffering comes
out of the whirlwind, it matters how we respond.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>How we respond is grounded in our seven principles and our
six sources. Our first source: “direct experience of that transcending mystery
and wonder, affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit
and an openness to the forces which create and uphold life.” I am not sure we
could go so far as amending this statement to say “the forces which create,
uphold and destroy life” because we might not want to be open to the
destructive forces. However, if we are to remain open to the creative forces of
life we may also want to be deeply aware of the destructive forces that are a part
of the natural world. We may want to be deeply aware of the potential for destruction
in each and every one of us. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Hinduism recognizes the destructive and transforming nature
of deity as Shiva and his consort Kali. In the Hindu pantheon Kali is associated
with death and destruction and is seen as the goddess of time and change. Shiva
is the third part of the Hindu Trimurti, in which the cosmic functions of
creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified by the forms of Brahmā
the creator, Vishnu the maintainer or preserver, and Shiva the destroyer or
transformer. Out of destruction comes change, out of destruction …
transformation. Joy and woe are woven fine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Job-like we have all cursed the very day we were born. Like
Job in the Hebrew Scriptures we have all encountered suffering that leaves us
feeling, and sometimes actually, stripped of everything we once possessed and
everything we once thought we were. In exaggerated folktale style, Job
successively loses his wealth, his children, and his physical health until he
is reduced to sitting among the ashes scraping his skin with shards of pottery.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Job’s friends try to convince him he must have done
something wrong, some unknown sin has caused his suffering. In the end Job is
forced to reject the shallow theology of his friends when he comes face to face
with a god who speaks out of the whirlwind. Job is shaken from his simplistic
understanding of the sort of puppet-master god who directs each and every human
action. Job wakes up. He is transformed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I am not saying that suffering is necessary for
understanding Life more deeply. I am saying that our suffering can bring us to
new understandings about Life, new ways of naming what we worship. Personally,
I would like to worship something that can protect me from further suffering,
but I don’t think that that god exists.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We worship here together knowing deeply that we are made
for both joy and sorrow. And when we come back to this realization time and
time again in the songs we sing, the joys and sorrows we share, the lighting of
the chalice, the realization that what we are worshipping we are becoming, we
can more fully participate in all of life. <i>We were made for joy and woe; And
when this we rightly know, Through the world we safely go. </i>It is this
understanding, born of experience that protects our hearts. We are not
protected from further suffering by a god who intervenes in human suffering. We
are protected by the lived experience of persistence and resilience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>William Blake also reminds us that “under every grief and
pine runs a joy with silken twine.” This is wisdom that can also bring us
comfort, but sometimes it is only in looking back on our suffering that we can
recognize the thread of joy running through all of life. If we rush too soon to
make meaning out of our suffering, we become like Job’s friends who are sure
they know what god is up to. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In the poem “Winter Solstice” Rebecca Parker writes:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='color:black'>In the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Who is the tsunami survivor when everything they once owned
is gone? How is a parent a parent when their child is gone? How is a woman a
woman when her breasts have been destroyed by cancer? How is a daughter a daughter
when her mother has died? When we write in a book, drop a stone in the water
and share our joys and sorrows, these questions sit with us, as we seek to
trust the natural cycles that point us towards love. We reject shallow
theologies, continuing in our search for theologies that teach us “everything
spins with joy even in immense darkness.” The winter solstice teaches us this
joy. Christmas teaches us this joy. Christmas teaches us that it comes not in
spite of darkness, but because of darkness. UU minister Earl Holt knows this
when he writes, “The vain trappings of the season do disguise a great
emptiness, but that emptiness waiting to be filled is the heart of Christmas
and in that emptiness, that darkness, Christmas is waiting to be born.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Christmas will come amidst the shootings and the cancer and
the recovery and the relapse. Christmas will come as the earth turns towards
more light. Pick up a thread of joy and a thread of sadness comes with it. This
is as it should be. The life lived fully knows the joy that runs deeply
underneath every sorrow and heartache. The life lived deeply listens to the winter
stories told and re-told with ears to hear the ancient wisdom in the symbol of
light shining in the darkness, and the darkness does not overcome it.</span></p>
