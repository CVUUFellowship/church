<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Draw the Circle
Wide</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>© Rev. Lora
Brandis </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Preached at the Conejo
Valley Unitarian Universalist Fellowship </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>October 6, 2013</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The circle is a
widely-used religious symbol, one that implies the movement of time just as the
planets move around the sun. The circle is often invoked as a symbol at
weddings when the rings are exchanged: the ring as an unbroken circle, a symbol
of unending love that will continue through the end of time. Circular temples,
the whirling dervishes, the circling of the Arab pilgrims around the Ka’aba
reflect the movement of the universe. A circle also symbolizes the continual
development of creation. As an image of that which has no beginning and no end,
the circle symbolizes eternity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Circles also
define. We say the “inner circle” knowing there can be an invisible line drawn
to define an in-group and an out-group. There are the Confucian concentric
circles of compassion, emanating out from the family to eventually encompass
the entire community. There is the sacred circle created intentionally by the
gathered community. Some religious ceremonies include the actual creation of a
circle – the drawing of a magical circle – a protective measure to keep
dangerous powers out and to hold love in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Our task as human
beings, according to Albert Einstein, is to free ourselves from the delusion of
being outside of the circle of the entire universe. The delusion of
separateness is a sort of prison. In Einstein’s words, “Our task must be to
free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion, to
embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.&quot; Our
task is to draw the circle wide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>To accomplish this
task we need the guidance of those who have gone before us, the sages and the
prophets who have left the comfort of the world they once knew, embarking on
the hero’s journey to the center of the self. Joseph Campbell said that “There
is a certain typical hero sequence of actions which can be detected in stories
from all over the world and from many periods of history.” The hero decides to
leave home to seek answers to life’s big questions. Along the way the hero will
experience loss, pain, rejection and danger. The archetypal mythic hero teaches
us how to leave the comfort of home, to expand our circle of compassion and how
to be the hero of our own life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The story of the
prodigal son is not usually told as a story of the archetypal mythic hero. It
is usually told as a cautionary tale: don’t be a squanderer like the prodigal
son. Sure your father will still love you, but really it’s bad to leave home
and spend all of your inheritance on loose living. I really think the prodigal
son has gotten a bad rap. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The prodigal son
asks his father to give him now what he would someday inherit, which is not the
same as his older brother would, by the way. In the time when this story was
first told, the older son would have inherited the bulk of the estate. The most
the youngest son could inherit would be one third. The Biblical text indicates
that in response to his youngest son’s request, the father actually gave both
sons their inheritance ahead of time which meant he no longer owned anything.
The father would have to rely on his oldest son to live. This is an outrageous
request, with an even more outrageous response from the father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Maybe the father
trusted his son or maybe he is the ideal, forgiving, father who loves without
condition. This is the father who traditional Christianity wants us to name as
God. In naming the father in this story God there were interpretations by the
early church that have led some scholars to wonder if Jesus actually told the
story. The early church liked to tell the story because they felt the younger
son represented the church and the older son represented the synagogue; the
father shows his preference for the younger son, just as God the father made a
new covenant which replaced the old.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This
interpretation from the early church is not only dangerous; it also ignores the
context of the story. The parable of the prodigal is one of three parables told
that defend Jesus’ habit of hanging out with “sinners:” the bad people, the
marginalized, the people “not like us.” The people on the outside of the
circle. Those people are the same sort that the youngest son hung out with when
he went away. Most of us leave the nest, the dovecote, the comfort of home.
Most of us have felt our “wings pass through all distance and fear in the
course of their (our) wanderings,” in the words of the poet Rilke. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This is not always
such a bad thing and I think Jesus knew this when he told the story, if he told
the story because the scholars remind us we don’t really know. Ultimately it
doesn’t matter who told the story because it is one of those timeless stories
that reaches beyond fact into the realm of mythology, into a universal truth that
becomes known through experience. We all must leave home and set out on a quest
to be the founder of our own life. Again, in the words of the poet Rilke: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Dove that ventured
outside, flying far</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>            from
the dovecote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Housed and
protected again, one with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>the day, the
night,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>knows what
serenity is, for she has felt</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>            her
wings</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>pass through all
distance and fear</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>in the course of
her wanderings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The parable of the
prodigal son appears in only one of the canonical gospels – the Gospel
According to Luke. Luke’s gospel is known as the gospel of the poor. When the
youngest son spent all of his money, he was poor. When the famine came he was
hungry. So hungry that he was willing to eat what the pigs ate. So hungry he
was willing to return to his father’s house as a servant. He spent his father’s
inheritance alright. He gave up a life of comfort and security and learned what
it is to experience loss. Like the Buddha who left his princely life, like
Jesus who went off to the desert, like Muhammad who withdrew for a time apart,
the prodigal son goes on a quest. This quest is usually judged as the
over-indulgent wasteful living of a spoiled frat boy, but it is a quest
none-the-less and the prodigal returns changed by where he has been.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I defend the
prodigal son because I know that spending his father’s inheritance is not just
about spending money. It’s also about losing the parts of his parents’
inheritance that are not his to keep. We inherit so much more from our parents
than money; some of us, like the poor in Jesus’ stories, will never inherit any
money from our parents. All of us do inherit thoughts and attitudes, ways of
being and sometimes we even inherit a religion. The youngest son loses the part
of his father’s inheritance that would have hardened his heart to the plight of
the poor and the hungry. The youngest son wins back his own heart, the won-back
heart of Rilke’s poem, because of all he was willing to give up. Part of what
he gave up, he gave up when he came home. The prodigal returns willing to
humble himself before his father. The prodigal returns no longer thinking only
of himself and his self-preservation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The end of the
story of the prodigal is open-ended. The older son, the dutiful one, stands at
the threshold deciding whether he will join the party or not. We do not know
what kind of man the prodigal will become, now that he is no longer the
“prodigal,” the recklessly extravagant one. The family is restored, but it will
never be the same because what was once lost has now been found. Heavier by the
weight of where he has been, the hero returns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Thousands of
would-be heroes leave their homes every day for the promise of a new life.
Theirs is not the conventional pattern of the mythical hero which, according to
Joseph Campbell, always includes departure, fulfillment and return. Departure
comes when a migrant leaves seeking work to support a family. Departure also
comes when a political refugee leaves seeking asylum. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There are
countless reasons for leaving home including to become a migrant worker or to
flee religious, political, and social persecution. Many people leave home
because of the effects of climate change. There is a couple trying to stay in
New Zealand because their country is disappearing under a rising ocean. The man
and his wife are “from Kiribati, a remote chain of atolls in the Pacific
halfway between Hawaii and Australia. It is one of the lowest lying nations on
Earth and as such, it is one of the first nations that will likely disappear as
ocean levels rise. Kiribati has a population of about 103,000 people, and is
one of the poorest countries in the world.” (<a
href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/a-man-in-new-zealand-is-seeking-asylum-from-climate-change">http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/a-man-in-new-zealand-is-seeking-asylum-from-climate-change</a>)
The 37-year-old man and his wife moved to New Zealand six years ago on work
visas, and have had three kids while living there. New Zealand immigration
authorities have already rejected the claim of this couple as climate change
refugees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The UN High
Commission for Refugees defines a refugee as someone with a “well-founded fear
of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a
particular social group or political opinion,” and “is outside the country of
his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail
himself of the protection of that country.” This definition does not include
climate change refugees. The case of the couple from Kiribati could be
precedent-setting. The UN estimates that as global temperatures continue to rise
there could be as many as 330 million people displaced world-wide. Their
definition of refugee will need to change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The conventional
pattern of the mythical hero is departure, fulfillment and return. The unconventional
pattern of the everyday immigrant hero sometimes includes fulfillment. It also
often includes enslavement. Undocumented immigrant workers are subject to
abusive working conditions because of the threat of deportation. Industries
that employ large numbers of immigrant workers, like poultry processing and
meat packing often do not pay employees for all the time they work and expose
workers to unsafe working conditions. An alarming statistic from the U.S.
Department of Labor shows that immigrants from Mexico are killed on their jobs
in the U.S. at a rate 75% higher than that of workers who were born here.</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Departure,
fulfillment and return. There are 11 million undocumented people living in our
country. Even as our government has been shut down this week, the deportations
have continued. Families live in constant fear, never knowing when ICE will
come and take parents away leaving children in an already crowded foster care
system. Often immigrant families are separated for decades without a legal path
for unification. Undocumented young adults are often deported to foreign lands
they left as infants, deported to places they do not know and to languages they
do not speak. Are they heroes or criminals? All of us are heroes, according to
Joseph Campbell. The hero’s adventure is the adventure of being alive. The
hero’s reward, the treasure unearthed during this adventure, is compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In dreams, the
circle is a symbol of the Self and indicates the end of the process of
individuation, of striving towards a psychic wholeness and self-realization –
the hero’s journey ending with a return to home, a return to self. In religious
symbolism the circle represents eternity, the ongoing act of creation. Our task
as human beings, according to Albert Einstein, is to free ourselves from the
delusion of being outside of the circle of the entire universe. The delusion of
separateness is a sort of prison. In Einstein’s words, “Our task must be to
free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion, to embrace
all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.&quot; Our task is
to draw the circle wide.</p>
