<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>I know this covenant by heart because I have
been repeating it most Sundays for more than ten years. I have often reflected
on the fact that we end with “thus do we covenant with each other” and didn’t
know there was an option to covenant with each other <u>and</u> with God until
I was more familiar with our hymnal <i>Singing the Living Tradition. </i>I
don’t know why God isn’t mentioned in the covenant at First Unitarian Church of
Dallas, but leaving those last three words out strengthens the covenant for me.
I am not objecting to the word God. Growing in harmony with the Divine implies
the transcendent, the vertical relationship. The accountability to something
larger than ourselves. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>It is the finality of covenanting with each
other that strengthens this statement for me. When Unitarian Universalists join
in community, we do not rest in our assurance of a covenant with God. We
acknowledge the horizontal relationship as the most important; our covenant
with each other sustains us as a religious community. We are <u>more</u> than a
collection of individuals on our own spiritual journeys. The covenant is how we
create what becomes the “more” in our gathering together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>There are many member churches of the Unitarian Universalist Association
that do not affirm each Sunday that love is the doctrine of their church, the
quest of truth its sacrament, etc. This independence is the foundation of our
congregational polity. During the year I served as a ministerial intern, every
time my husband and I repeated their covenant, we had to lock eyes to help each
other through the end. Horizon UU, in Carrollton, TX is a church plant from the
Dallas church. It has been there twenty-five years and has its own covenant and
mission. Their covenant is the same as First Dallas through the line “to seek
knowledge in freedom.” And then you can hear who they are as a community in the
final lines of their covenant: “To serve humanity in harmony with the earth, Thus,
do we covenant together.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Conrad Wright, the former professor of American church history at Harvard
Divinity School, wrote that in many of our churches “ancient covenants still
serve their essential function: to make churches out of collections of
individuals; to establish community” (<i>Walking Together</i>, p. 8). We can
pick up the thread of history with the covenant used in the Dallas church and
follow it back to New England to the Bible and further back to pre-biblical
agreements. The Dallas church’s covenant is a variation of the covenant found as
number 471 in <i>Singing the Living Tradition</i>. This covenant can also be
found in a book entitled <i>Antiphonal Readings for Free Worship</i>, arranged
by L. Griswold Williams and published in 1933. Conrad Wright gives us an
example of an early Puritan covenant from 1629 Salem. The concept of covenant
is embedded in the Cambridge Platform of 1648, which still influences the way
we gather in community today.</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The first
covenants were political treaties in the ancient Near East dating as far back
as the fourth century B.C.E. Consequences for breaking covenants were clearly
stated in the covenants themselves. These ancient political covenants were kept
in shrines and holy places because ancient people saw the gods as active in
human history. These covenants may have been enshrined, but they were also political
promises between groups of people to define territories and to maintain
agreements. According to Reverend Burton Carley, minister of the First
Unitarian Church of Memphis, “The Hebrew people took the political covenant
that came before them and elevated it into another dimension. They used
covenant to describe the divine / human relationship thus imparting to it a
deep theological and moral significance.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The first covenant
in the Hebrew Scriptures is in the ninth chapter of Genesis in the story of
Noah and the flood. The second covenant is also in Genesis in the story of
Abraham and God’s covenant with the people of Israel. Carley points out that
Unitarian theologian James Luther Adams described these covenants as “covenants
of being.” What Adams meant, Carley tells us, “is that the covenant is not just
between human beings but also with the very ground of reality itself.  …This
reality that is a ‘creative, sustaining, commanding, judging, transforming Power,’
requires a mutuality that is ethical and sustained by a loving trust. It is a
covenant with all living creatures that endures through every generation into
the future” (James Luther Adams from The Essential James Luther Adams: Selected
Essays and Addresses, quoted by Burton D. Carley in his paper “We Covenant”
presented to The Prairie Group, November 12, 2007).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This larger
covenant calls us out of our individual selves into community. This is the
covenant that allows us to see our self in another and in that seeing to become
transformed. As Unitarian Universalists we each get to define how we respond to
this larger covenant, this “covenant of being.” When we sign the membership
book, agree to our church’s covenant, maybe even recite it in church together,
we are committing ourselves not to a smaller covenant, but to a covenant that
evolves rather than endures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>One of the
problems with our covenants, according to Conrad Wright, “is that we do not
take them seriously enough. We do not remind ourselves that a covenant is an
agreement made between parties, not a statement by an individual to be
discarded or forgotten unilaterally” (<i>Walking Together</i>, p. 9). Our
covenantal faith calls us to be in relationship, to walk together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When I hear the
simple words of the Salem covenant: “we…doe bynd our selves…to walke together,”
I think of the famous quote attributed to the philosopher Albert Camus. “Don't
walk behind me, I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me, I may not follow.
Just walk beside me and be my friend.” I say attributed to Camus because he may
or may not have said it. I hope he didn’t say it because I can’t imagine that a
Nobel Laureate would have said something so vapid and superficial. Now before
you tell me this is your favorite quote and you have it embroidered on a pillow
at home, let me explain what I mean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Walking together
is often very difficult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This is the time
of year that we as Unitarian Universalists like to remind the rest of America
how proud we are to have descended from the Pilgrims and their quest for
religious freedom. It is true that we can trace the roots of our covenantal
faith to the Protestant Reformation and how it influenced an English minister
to lead his people in the development of a congregational covenant. This
congregation and others like it who wanted to further remove Catholic elements
from the Church of England became known as Puritans. We can trace the roots of
our covenantal faith to these Puritans and those among them known as the Pilgrims.
We can also trace the roots of our faith to the Mayflower Compact, a document
written because walking together is often very difficult.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The Mayflower
didn’t carry one happy band of Pilgrims covenanted to walk together as friends.
Only half of the group came from one congregation who had escaped religious
persecution in England, spent some time in Holland and from there headed to
America. This was the group we call the Pilgrims, the others on the Mayflower the
Pilgrims called the Strangers because they were not from their congregation. Trouble
arose when the ship was unable to land at their intended destination, the two
groups found themselves at odds with each other. The Mayflower Compact, a
covenant, was designed by the leaders of the two groups to create a civic
structure that recognized they needed to walk together in order to survive. In
this covenant can be seen the beginnings of democracy in America. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was the
Puritans of Massachusetts Bay Colony, who came after the Pilgrims, who gave us
the next historic covenant in America. The Cambridge Platform of 1648
summarized the elements of a congregation’s covenant as 1. a voluntary
agreement, 2. a relationship with God, 3. public worship and 4. observance of
the ordinances of baptism and communion. Today we understand covenant as a voluntary
agreement to gather for worship and mutual help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The legacy of the
Cambridge Platform is not only in the covenant; it is also in how we organize
ourselves as covenantal bodies. Here are some of the characteristics of how we
gather as a religious body that come to us from the Cambridge Platform. The
church is self-governing. The laity is the ultimate authority in the church.
Membership is voluntary. Ministers are called out of the laity, with each
church having the authority to ordain and call its own minister. Churches are
distinct and equal, and are called into fellowship and cooperation with each
other.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Just as each congregation is free to make its own covenant,
each is also free to create its own mission. Covenant is the promise we make to
each other in <u>how</u> we will be the gathered community. Mission is <u>who</u>
the congregation will be in the larger community and in the world. I know First
Unitarian of Dallas’ covenant by heart, but I had to look up the mission
because it recently changed. Their old mission: “The First Unitarian Church of
Dallas creates and nurtures a liberal religious community where all souls shall
grow in harmony with the divine through worship, education, service, and fellowship”
echoes language from the covenant. Their new mission, six words that fit nicely
underneath the name of the church on everything from t-shirts to the web site,
is: “reaching deeper to be the way.” Like our covenants, our missions continue
to evolve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The mission of this Fellowship just changed and many of you
were here last week when I announced the change. The old mission: “to build and
support a community committed to living Unitarian Universalist values.” The new
mission: “to nurture spiritually courageous people who transform the world
through justice and compassion.” We do not have an explicit covenant that we
express liturgically in our worship service each week. As a member congregation
of the Unitarian Universalist Association we do covenant to affirm and promote
our seven principles. And we have a statement of purpose that implies a sort of
covenant. We have just adopted a new mission; the next step in becoming who we
are together because of our new ministry is to create an explicit covenant. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Many congregations adopt a covenant of right relations
which goes beyond the covenant designed by L. Griswold Williams for the free
church of the 1930s. These documents define how we create congregations as safe
places to express our individual beliefs. Covenants help us draw boundaries
between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. They are statements that can be
included in worship or read before meetings. The Mayflower Compact, a covenant,
recognized that the Pilgrims and the Strangers needed to walk together in order
to survive. We no longer need covenants in order to survive the harshness of
New England winters, but we do need covenants to recognize that walking
together can often be very difficult. Walking together can test us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Barbara Brown Taylor writes that “the world’s great
religions have always required communities of people to make them work… these
communities are the concrete places where the teachings of the religion are
tested” (<i>An Altar in the World</i>, p. 93). Much has been written about the
lack of a cohesive Unitarian Universalist theology because we do not have a
binding creed. We do not ask you to sign a belief statement when you sign the
membership book. We ask you to covenant with us, to walk with us in the spirit
of love and with mutual respect. This is the teaching of our religion; you
might even call it our theology – the covenant. This promise that we make to
dwell together in peace, to be guided by love, to seek knowledge in freedom, to
respect each other, to join in meaningful action, to use the democratic
process, to affirm the dignity and worth of every human being…. This promise,
this evolving covenant binds us one to the other and to that which calls us out
of ourselves. Thus we are bound, to walk together. Thus do we covenant with
each other.</span></p>
