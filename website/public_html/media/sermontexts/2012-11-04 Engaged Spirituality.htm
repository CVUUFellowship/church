<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I have not watched any of the debates, presidential
or otherwise. I have preferred experiencing the debates via posts from friends
on Facebook, headlines from Democracy Now and Internet memes about Big Bird,
binders and bayonets. It has been entertaining at times. Primarily it has been
disheartening. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Whatever the results of next week’s election there
will still be work to be done. There will always be work to be done. What
better time of year to ask ourselves what an engaged spirituality looks like
then the time of year when we are asked what an engaged citizenship looks like?
As we cast our vote we can embody our values and allow our hearts to open wide
as an engaged people of faith. You may be reluctant, like I am, to allow your
heart to open wide given the current climate of attack-ads, half-truths and
empty promises. It is challenging to remain engaged when we fear the outcome,
grow angry at the opposition and mostly just want to turn away in disgust. We
are disheartened.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Dis + hearten. Dis meaning “apart,” “asunder,”
“away,” “utterly,” or having a privative, negative, or reversing force. Hearten
meaning to give courage or confidence to. I am not encouraged by the current
climate of political exchange in our country. My heart is asunder, broken into
a million pieces by not only the political process but also by the lack of
compassion so many of us in this country have for others who do not hold our
same views, look the same way we do, or have access to the same resources as
the wealthiest among us have.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I have not watched any of the debates. Instead, I
have been reading Parker J. Palmer’s <i>Healing the Heart of Democracy: The
Courage to Create a Politics Worthy of the Human Spirit</i>. Palmer is a
Quaker.  He is also an author, educator, and activist who focuses on issues in
education, community, leadership, spirituality and social change. In his book
he distinguishes between the heart broken into a million pieces (the way I feel
right now) and the heart broken wide open to the possibility of transformation
(the way I hope to feel once the election is over).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He also reclaims the original definition of “heart,”
which “comes from the Latin <i>cor</i> and points not merely to our emotions
but to the core of the self, that center place where all of our ways of knowing
converge – intellectual, emotional, sensory, intuitive, imaginative,
experiential, relational, and bodily, among others,” he writes. He also writes
that, “The heart is where we integrate what we know in our minds with what we
know in our bones, the place where our knowledge can become more fully human”
(page 6). This is similar to the Buddhist concept of locating the mind in the
center of the heart. Palmer proposes that there is a heart of democracy in this
country, one that we can more fully connect to when we are connected to our own
hearts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Indiana Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock
refused to apologize for saying that when pregnancy results from rape then that
is &quot;something God intended.&quot; His comments can be added to a long list
of disturbing pronouncements about reproductive rights coming from people,
mostly men, currently running for office. At a press conference held to defend
his remarks, Mourdock said &quot;I spoke from my heart. And speaking from my
heart, speaking from the deepest level of my faith, I would not apologize. I
would be less than faithful if I said anything other than life is precious, I
believe it's a gift from God.” He spoke from his heart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Former Arkansas governor and ordained Southern
Baptist minister Mike Huckabee recently created a video entitled “Test of Fire”
to encourage Christians to vote their values. In his narration, cast against
fiery images suggesting eternal damnation, Huckabee states that many of the
issues this November are non-negotiable for Christians including the right to
life, the traditional definition of marriage and a religious liberty challenged
by government-mandated health insurance that covers abortion and contraception.
The video ends with this invitation from Huckabee: “Your vote will affect the
future and be recorded in eternity. Will you vote the values that will stand
the test of fire?” Here is a man, I would imagine, who thinks that he is also
speaking from his heart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I would also imagine that most of the candidates
running right now would claim they are speaking from their hearts. I would
imagine, also, that the religious leaders currently claiming to know the heart
of God are speaking from the deepest level of their faith. Rather than judge
another person’s faith we turn away in disagreement. Depression covers anger.
Disempowerment visits the disheartened. Our hearts ache for a politics worthy
of the human spirit.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The poet Mary Oliver, perhaps at her most prophetic,
writes on empire declaring, “We will be known as a culture that feared death
and adored power, that tried to vanquish insecurity for the few and cared
little for the penury of the many…. And they will say that this structure was held
together politically, which it was, and they will say also that our politics
was no more than an apparatus to accommodate the feelings of the heart, and
that the heart, in those days, was small, and hard, and full of meanness.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The role of the religious community is to develop
our inner lives so that when we face adversity our hearts are a muscle made
stronger, a space expanded by the possibility of healing. The heart we develop
here is not “small, and hard, and full of meanness.” We develop the heart here
for two reasons: to nurture spiritual courage and to transform the world
through justice and compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Here we affirm love as our guiding principle. Here
we show an election-season video called &quot;Stand with Love&quot; created by
Elliott Cennamo, a motion graphic designer and Unitarian Universalist from
Columbus, Ohio. In that video’s narration we hear statements like: “You know
the religious right. Well, we’re the religious left. You might not have heard
as much about us, but that’s about to change.” The narrator of this video makes
a different invitation than Mike Huckabee does, the narrator of “Stand with
Love” invites us to stay in the conversation, that “This November, amid the
fear and hate remember the one thing that can truly make a change, the one thing
that can bring clarity to our disagreements and justice to the offense, take a
stand but never forget what side you stand on and when someone asks for your
vote stand with love.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In contrasting the two election videos, it might be
easy for us to become smug. We’re standing with love and Mike Huckabee’s
Christians are insinuating that our values mean that we’ll go to hell. We’re
better because we vote with our hearts wide open and they vote with hearts
hardened by literal translations of scripture and minds narrowed by judgment.
Standing with love means staying in the conversation when we are being called
wrong. Standing with love means staying in the conversation when all we want to
do is yell, “You’re wrong!” in return. Standing with love means listening
deeply to another’s broken heart and finding common ground.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the religious right defines God as a force that
causes everything in the universe including rape, pregnancy and hurricanes, the
religious left can define God as a force of love that arises out of an
unnamable mystery that inspires awe. When those whose hearts have been broken
apart by life make inaccurate, unscientific statements about weather and
women’s bodies, those whose hearts are broken wide open can stay in the
conversation with compassion. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I would like to imagine a conversation with Mike
Huckabee, or Richard Mourdock or Todd Akin or perhaps Joe Walsh. I will
probably never have the opportunity to talk with any of them, but I like to
imagine it anyway. I like to imagine this conversation so I can practice
conversations that move me out of my usual comfortable liberal oasis. </p>

</span>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Last month I sat across the table from a Catholic
lay leader who was working with his congregation to make sure that Propositions
34 and 36 are passed. These Propositions, the repeal of the death penalty and
the revision of the three strikes law, are very important to his mostly
Hispanic congregation. These Propositions are also supported by Progressive
Christians United and the Unitarian Universalist Legislative Ministry of
California. In that conversation the Catholic and the liberal religious can
find common ground.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In another recent interfaith conversation I found
myself sitting at a table with a Hindu, a Buddhist, a UU, a Jew, two Catholics
and two Mormons. When the Jewish woman sitting next to me turned to the Mormons
and the Catholics and said, “I think we probably share some views on abortion,”
I decided that I needed to connect with a colleague across the room. Some
conversations are harder than others.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Parker Palmer writes that “Abortion is one of the
many issues that generate what some people have called the ‘politics of rage.’
And yet rage is simply one of the masks that heartbreak wears.” He writes about
daylong dialogue programs where people are not allowed to tell their position
on a difficult issue like abortion until the end of the day. Instead people are
instructed to share the personal stories that created their beliefs. Listening
to each other’s stories is one way to stretch our hearts. When we see ourselves
in the pain in another’s eyes, our hearts expand, soften and fill with
compassion.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There are spiritual disciplines such as the Buddhist
practice of lovingkindness (<i>metta</i>) that invite us to an intentional
opening of the heart. A yoga practice offers physical ways to open our heart
and to release held pain. An ongoing practice of meditation, with the intention
of cultivating compassion in our thoughts, speaking, and actions, also leads to
the way of the open heart. In our own tradition, practicing democracy in our
congregations is a spiritual discipline that can also lead to a large and open
heart, filled with love. Practicing democracy in our congregations takes us
through difficult conversations where we are asked to hold our differences
within the context of a covenant. Being together in a religious community
becomes a spiritual discipline when we move past surface conversations about
the details of our lives and tell our stories to each other in ways that open
our hearts wide to an intimacy that keeps are hearts open when life is
conspiring to tear them apart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As Unitarian Universalists we affirm our fifth
principle: the right of conscience and the use of the democratic process within
our congregations and in society at large. Who we are as a people of faith
makes it difficult for us NOT to participate in the public square. When we vote
we can vote with hearts open wide with a hope held deep in our bones. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>How will our hearts feel November 7th? It can depend
on the outcome of the elections. It can also depend on our capacity to keep our
hearts open. According to Parker Palmer, “Politics in the hands of those whose
hearts have been broken open, not apart, helps us hold our differences
creatively and use our power courageously for the sake of a more equitable,
just, and compassionate world” (page 18). May it be so and may we be the people
to make it so.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b>Practical tools for opening the heart: </b>Thich
Nhat Hahn, the Vietnamese Buddhist monk and peace activist, offers tools for
the engaged spiritual life. An engaged spirituality is ultimately an embodied
spirituality. One’s engagement with the world arises out of one’s body and its
unique experience of emotion, imagination and intuition. One simple practice
that Thich Nhat Hahn promotes might help us get through the days leading to the
election. He advises that before we get out of bed in the morning we smile.
Just take a few moments before we sit up in the morning to notice our breath,
pay attention to the stirrings of our waking body and simply smile. Another
technique he teaches is to imagine we are holding a rose, breathing in we
imagine the beautiful aroma and we smile. Breathing in, the beauty of the
imagined rose fills our thoughts; breathing out, we extend beauty and
lovingkindness to all beings.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Another practical tool comes from the book we are
studying together this year, <i>Theology Ablaze</i> by Tom Owen-Towle (page
146-147). Tom shares a Nepalese body prayer that he received from UU minister
Orlanda Brugnola. This body prayer is Tom’s morning practice:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Begin by standing, planting your feet firmly on the floor and
bending your knees slightly. Cup your hands right above your navel, in a
receiving posture. Affirm being alive with words of your choosing. Here are
Tom’s: <i>“I am a child of the universe. I belong here. It’s good for me to be
alive.” </i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Now lift your hands in a prayerful gesture towards the sky and
say out loud words of gratitude. Tom uses the E.E. Cummings’ line <i>“I thank
You God for most this amazing day.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>After your hands are stretched to their highest point open them
wide into the shape of a chalice to receive the gifts the day brings, affirming
in your own words what Tom says: <i>“Into my hands are received today’s
delights and difficulties, sorrows and joys.”</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Then circle your hands back to the beginning position and offer
yourself to the day using Tom’s or similar words: <i>“I promise to spread these
blessings to every living entity that I greet this precious day.”</i> Repeat
the body prayer three or four times.</p>
