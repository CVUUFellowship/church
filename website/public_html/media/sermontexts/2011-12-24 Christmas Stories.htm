<title>When Paul sent a letter to the Christian's in Rome He wrote saying this,
“For by the grace given to me I say to every one of you not to think more
highly of yourself than you ought to think, but to think with sober
discernment, as God has distributed to</title>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tonight we tell
the ancient story and sing the carols of old. Gather round the tree. Look for
the star. Light the candles. There are many stories to be told this night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>THE story as told
in the biblical account proclaims, “to you is born this day in the city of
David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord” (Luke 2:11). This is the way the
story is being told throughout the world tonight, and for those who tell it in
this particular way there is only one story to be told. If you don’t believe it
then you are not part of the story, part of the real meaning of Christmas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We tell the story
somewhat differently here. Here we say there are many Christmas stories, not
just the story of a child of lowly birth “whose uncommon life has been long
remembered” (“Why Not A Star” Margaret Gooding).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Here we also tell
the story of the tree. The tree’s story begins before the birth of Christ. In
ancient northern Europe people decorated their houses with greenery to persuade
the rest of nature, which was lying dormant in winter, to come back to life.
The Christmas tree, an evergreen, is a reminder of that ancient custom,
although the Christmas tree’s story is more directly related to the World Tree
found in Norse mythology. Early Christians told the story of St. Boniface who
cut down the Norseman’s tree and found a fir tree growing in its place. This
proved to him that the Christian God replaced the Norse gods of the local
tribe. Most Christmas stories are like that, you dig below the surface and
you’ll find another story in the roots.</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eventually the
tree travels from Northern Europe to America. Lots of stories are told about
the first tree in America. Apparently many cities want to take credit for the
first Christmas tree in our country. The best story to tell here on this night
is the story of Charles Follen, a German immigrant to Boston who may have been
the first in America to decorate a tree for Christmas in the early 1800s. Charles
was the first professor of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" title="German language"><span
style='color:windowtext'>German</span></a> at Harvard University, an outspoken
opponent of slavery and a Unitarian minister.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tonight we tell
the ancient story and sing the carols of old. We tell the story of the tree and
a Unitarian minister who brought this ancient symbol to this country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Here we also tell
the story of the star. We like to tell the science behind the story of the star
here. It is now possible to map the night sky as it looked in Jerusalem the
night that Jesus was born. Scientists can look at what astronomical events took
place during that time. “Some wonder if the star of Bethlehem occurred when
Jupiter and Saturn crossed,” writes the poet Timothy Steele. Most scientists
think that this conjunction would not have caused anything spectacular in the
sky above Bethlehem. The star could have been Halley’s Comet or maybe a
supernova, which occurred in a nearby galaxy the night Jesus was born.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Except we don’t
really know when Jesus was born. At first the early Christians didn’t even
celebrate Jesus’ birth because they didn’t celebrate any birthdays. Celebrating
birthdays was a pagan practice, not something the Christians looked favorably
upon. Eventually Christians were surrounded by enough pagans who not only
celebrated birthdays in general, they also celebrated the birthdays of the gods
they worshipped. So a date needed to be set and eventually the date we have
come to associate as Jesus’ birthday was picked – January 6<sup>th</sup>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This is another
story where we have to dig deeper to find its ancient roots. At first Jesus’
birthday was celebrated on the 6<sup>th</sup> of January because it already had
significance for other Greek deities like Dionysus. Eventually the celebration
was moved to the 25<sup>th</sup> of December as Christianity became centered in
Rome, where their custom was to celebrate the birth of the Sun with the
lighting of lights during the darkest of days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tonight we tell
the ancient story and sing the carols of old. We tell the story of the star
understanding science might explain its existence, knowing that poetry better
explains the star’s significance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Here we also tell
the story of St. Nicholas, Santa Claus. In France he is Pére Noel, in England
Father Christmas. “Santa is represented by Mother Star in Poland; by Kristkind
in Bavaria; Jul-Nisse in Denmark; Kris Kringle in Germany, and by Grandpa
Koleda in Bulgaria” (<i>Celebrating Christmas</i>, p. 17). In America Saint
Nicholas becomes Santa Claus because of the Dutch Americans’ pronunciation. We
know him best as the broad-faced, round-bellied, jolly old fellow from Clement
Clark Moore’s poem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The story I tell
each year about Santa Claus is a story about my youngest daughter Zoe, who one
Christmas Eve when she was three or four years old decided she would stay up
and wait for Santa to come. We arrived home from church slightly after
midnight. At the time I was a single parent and had a lot still left to do to
get ready for Santa’s arrival. As I cleaned the kitchen and finished baking
(Santa would expect some cookies and milk when he arrived), Zoe sat on the
floor of the kitchen with a pillow and blanket listening attentively for the
sounds of Santa’s sleigh. As I worked I glanced down every once and awhile and
saw her alert little body slowly move towards the blanket, the pillow and the
floor. By around 2am, Zoe was asleep and Santa still had not arrived. As I
carried her to bed I thought I heard something, but I was too tired to
investigate. The next morning we could tell that Santa had been there while we
slept. Under the tree was a fully-assembled Barbie house complete with working
lights and a buzzing doorbell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tonight we tell
the ancient story and sing the carols of old. We tell the story of Santa Claus
and the wonder of a child; the hope embodied by all children on this special
night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Here we also tell
the story of the child called Jesus. It is <u>one</u> of the many stories we
tell. We tell it to remind us that “each night a child is born is a holy night”
(Sophia Lyon Fahs). We tell it to remind us that the potential to live an
uncommon life is within each of us. We tell it to remind ourselves of the
sacred power of all of the stories of Christmas, including our own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Tonight we tell
the ancient story and sing the carols of old. Gather round the tree. Look for
the star. Light the candles. There are many stories to be told.</p>
