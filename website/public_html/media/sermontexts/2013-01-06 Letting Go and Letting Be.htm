style='color:black'>During the holidays I visited with a friend who is dying. She
has had cancer for the entire time I have known her, almost ten years now. She
isn’t in hospice, so you could say that she is not actively dying. She is still
receiving chemo, still expecting to live for a year or two. We sat by the fire
in her home, beautifully decorated for the holidays by loving friends. We
talked of ordinary things and yes, occasionally about death. I have no idea
when I will see her again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This could be said of all the friends I visited during the
holidays: “I visited with my friends who are dying.” I have no idea when or if
I will see them again. For we are all dying and we do not know when the
appointed hour will come.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Buddhist teacher Joan Halifax made a commitment to be with
others as they died after witnessing her grandmother’s death. Her grandmother’s
death was surrounded by fear, not from her grandmother, but from her family who
could not bear to watch her grandmother suffer. Roshi Halifax looked to
Buddhism shortly after her grandmother’s death and found within it a saving
message: we are all responsible for our own way through suffering and suffering
is lessened when we develop strength along with tenderness in the midst of our
ever-changing lives. Nothing is permanent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The poet Anne Hillman writes,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i><span
style='color:black'>At the brink of death;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Moving from one year to the next is a liminal moment, a
threshold moment. We always stand “at the brink of death” but at the death of
one year and the birth of another, this truth reveals itself for further
examination. We make “best of” lists, memorialize the recently deceased and
resolve to live differently in the year ahead. We stand at the doorway of the
New Year. It is a perfect time to practice dying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Western culture is not comfortable with practicing dying.
Western culture has a tendency to institutionalize dying, to remove it from
sight. Remember the fear that was stirred up by talks of “death panels” being
included in the President’s healthcare plan? The inclusion of assessing dying
patients’ needs as a way to reduce end of life costs is a countercultural message
in a society that treats death as an illness. Cynical politicians fed on our
collective fear of dying and stirred up controversy for their own political
gain. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“Perhaps, from the great spiritual traditions of the past,
we can retrieve a vision of dying that makes it possible for us to embrace the
unknown without being paralyzed with fear, and to embrace the truth of
impermanence as we open our arms to the world,” Joan Halifax tells us. “Plato
told his students, ‘Practice dying.’ The Christian monks of medieval Europe
ritually whispered to one another, ‘Memento mori’ (‘Remember death’) (<i>Being
with Dying</i>, page 48). In our own tradition we have Ralph Waldo Emerson,
emulating the practice of Buddhist monks, opening the coffin of his
much-beloved first wife thirteen months after her death. Twenty-five years
later when the coffin of his son was being moved, fifteen years after his
death, Emerson again opened the coffin. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This seems morbid and ghoulish, hard to comprehend in a
world that keeps death far away from us in sterile hospital rooms and lavish,
over-priced burial arrangements. Emerson’s insistence on seeing the reality of
impermanence is neither morbid nor ghoulish. This was Emerson learning to live
in the ever present now while freeing himself from the limitations of the past.
If you have ever witnessed a loved one’s cremains being released back to the
elements, you know the healing that is possible in the stark acknowledgement
that life and death are constantly caught in a loving dance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We practice dying when we let go of the way we thought our
lives would look. We practice dying when we surrender to the way things are. We
practice dying when we let go and let be. The brackets we impose on one year
versus the next also allow us to practice dying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>While I was sitting with all of my dying friends during the
holidays I heard many times what a horrible year this past year has been. One
friend wrote in her Christmas card, “2012 has been the worst year of my life.”
Others echoed this with statements like, “hardest year yet” and “glad to see
this year die.” We stand at the threshold of the New Year and die with the old
one, opening our arms wide to the world. Risking everything, we step out into
the unknown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This is what it is to die – this stepping off the world.
Historically Unitarian Universalists have been more concerned with creating
heaven on earth than they have been with what happens after we die.
Universalists are known for the heresy of universal salvation, the idea that in
the end all of us will be in heaven, in the end all beings will be reconciled
to God’s love. Unitarians are known for the heresy of rejecting a triune God,
tracing our roots back to that most famous of heretics – Arius. Arius, made
famous by his opposition to the ideas that won out at the Council of Nicaea in
325 CE. Arius is also famous for not dying very well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Amazingly, Arius’ death is still held up as an example of
divine punishment even eighteen centuries after his demise. This obsession with
the good death comes about in practices such as the ars moriendi, or the art of
dying. Developed in the Middle Ages in response to the Black Death, the
horrible plague that swept through Europe killing upwards of 60 percent of its
population in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. The <i>Ars Moriendi</i> is
instruction on the art of dying well. It is a thread that runs through much of
Christian theology and practice. The good death somehow proves that one has
lived well. I will spare you the details of the heretic Arius’ death; it was
messy and sudden. His opponents of the time believed that his death was divine
punishment. Later historians believe, given the nature of his sudden and messy
death, that he was poisoned by his opponents. We do not really know. I do know
that people die well every day, people who some think deserve a death as harsh
as Arius’. Death is not a punishment. Death is a natural part of the order of
things. It is the way things are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I do not know what happens when we die. I am attracted to
the idea described by philosophers and theologians as objective immortality.
Objective immortality is not the same as subjective immortality: the notion
that we live after death in a perfected fashion of the way we lived before
death. Objective immortality means that every thought, every action, every way
of being we have created while living, lives on in a perpetual web of
existence, described by some as the mind of God or by Emerson as the Oversoul.
We are in the lives we leave behind, not just in children we may create, but in
every life we touch during our brief sojourn in this world that we are destined
to leave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Dying is the ultimate act of surrender because we truly do
not know what comes next. At the beginning of a New Year we would like to know
what comes next. We would like to make what comes next happen based on all of
the supposedly bad things that happened in the old year. In the art of
practicing dying we give up controlling what comes next and we surrender to the
glorious possibility that Life can surprise us. In the art of practicing dying
we learn to let go and let be.</span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";

</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I do believe that “something new is being born in us”
always (Anne Hillman). As individuals, as a church community, as a nation, as a
global community, something new is being born when we let ourselves be open to
the possibility of a new creation that arises out of the death of the old. If
we let ourselves become vulnerable to the exquisite beauty of our humanity, a
doorway opens to that which comes next. And we don’t have to wait for the New
Year to let go and let be. Impermanence teaches us that we can start a new day
at any time. Death teaches us that the New Year can start at any time. If we
find ourselves weighted down in the misery of a bad year, we are free to claim
“from this moment on is a New Year!” Happy New Year!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>From this moment on we can practice dying. We can practice
not knowing what the next moment looks like. Being stuck to the spot of this
moment now relieves us of the burden of assuming we know the dire outcomes. We
give up fixed ideas about ourselves and others and in the words of the poet,
open ourselves “To a softer, more permeable aliveness” (Hillman). We can
practice dying by being fully present with both the joy and woe of the world,
just as it is, without attachment to any outcome. And we can practice dying by
proclaiming our commitment to freeing all beings from suffering, to dedicating
ourselves to the liberation of the human spirit from limiting ideas about death
and dying and fear of the unknown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Roshi Joan Halifax offers nine contemplations that can
guide us in our living and our dying. They can also guide us as we let go of
one year and face the unknown of the New Year. As we contemplate the fact that
death is inevitable, that our life-span is ever-decreasing and that death can
come at any moment we take an inventory of the past year asking ourselves what
steps we can take to wake up to life now. What intention do we bring to this
New Year to be more aware, to slow down and really listen, to give ourselves
away in unconditional generosity? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We like to play guessing-games about when we’ll die,
gathering evidence from our genetics controlled by lifestyle choices of diet
and exercise. In reality we are bound by the fourth contemplation: “my life
span is not fixed.” We cannot control how we die; death comes with many causes.
Our bodies are fragile and vulnerable. Just as we cannot control how we die, we
cannot control the genetics we have inherited, the freeway accident, or the
aging process. As we enter this New Year, practicing dying, practicing letting
go and letting be may we learn one more time to relinquish control, to welcome
all guests who show up to remind us how to live.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The seventh contemplation is akin to “you can’t take it
with you.” Roshi Joan states it this way: “My material resources will be of no
use to me” after I die. Nothing and no one can save us from death. Even our own
bodies will betray us at the moment of death. Deeply contemplating these things
we approach the New Year with a sense of freedom, sharing our material wealth
now, knowing that impermanence teaches us generosity. Impermanence teaches us
that change is inevitable; nothing can save us from this truth. Fear does not
protect us from the inevitability of change and the finality of death. Even our
own bodies will change this year and every year whether we make resolutions to
change them or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Nothing is permanent. Hallelujah! We stand at a new
doorway. Hallelujah! Death and Life are inseparable. Hallelujah!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This is the liberating fact: not that we die and go to a
better place, but that we die each moment. Each moment we can lay our burdens
down and live differently now. We can develop strength and tenderness in the
midst of our ever-changing lives. The hallelujah that I invite you into each
Sunday is not just a substitute for applause that is out of place in a worship
experience. It is natural to want to applaud, to show our appreciation. When we
clap our hands we affirm our role as spectators. On the contrary, when we shout
hallelujah we shout as full participants. The hallelujah I invite you into
every Sunday is an invitation to lay your burden down, to let go and let be, to
say yes to life, to shout hallelujah and step through the doorway to what comes
next – to be full participants in a life worth dying for. Hallelujah and Amen!</span></p>
