old and changing every day. How do we respond to a leaderless, unstructured
event? How do we respond to a movement that is creating itself with each action
it develops, each action constructed out of a direct democracy that honors the
expression of each voice? How do we – a creedless, living faith tradition bound
by no dogma, led by the democratic process in our own autonomous congregations,

I participated in Occupy Thousand Oaks, I stood next to a woman I had just met.
As we were exchanging names and niceties a woman in a car stopped at the light
started yelling at us. Before I knew it I was drawn into a shouting exchange
that included the woman in the car yelling at us that it was all “Obama’s
fault” and the woman next to me accusing her of being a racist. I shouted at
them both: “This is not about blame. This is about coming together for the good
of all.” The woman in the car probably didn’t hear me; she rolled her window up
and drove off as the light changed. The woman beside me did hear me, laughing
my response off as appropriate for a minister. I laughed with her at first
until I realized that my response is appropriate for all people of faith, not
just for their ministers.</span></p>

in 1967, shortly before he was assassinated in Memphis in 1968. The book is
King’s prescription for what comes next after the first wave of extreme change that
was the result of his call for equality. What King hoped would be next was a
radical solution to the end of poverty; the end of the book is King’s argument
for each person’s right to a living wage. More than forty years ago Dr. King

stability of the large world house which is ours will involve a revolution of
values to accompany the scientific and freedom revolutions engulfing the earth.
We must rapidly begin the shift from a “thing”-oriented society to a
“person”-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and
property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets
of racism, materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered. A
civilization can flounder as readily in the face of moral and spiritual
bankruptcy as it can through financial bankruptcy (p. 216).</span></p>

where the civil rights movement was in 1967 King observed that there had been a
shift from an emphasis on personal dignity to an emphasis on programs: programs
that changed the basic system of social and economic control. In this shift
there was a potential for the movement to go beyond race to embrace economic
justice for all. King warned that after the first wave of extreme change,
Americans would cling to the status quo for fear of a more profound and lasting
change. No longer clinging to the status quo, we are awake now and occupying
Wall Street.</span></p>

an early snow threatened to shut down OccupyWallStreet. New York City mayor
Michael Bloomberg, using a &quot;health and safety inspection” as his justification,
instructed NYPD and FDNY to seize the fuel and generators used by demonstrators
to power their media center and kitchen. The demonstrators, used to responding
to an ever-changing environment, asked for help from a cycling advocacy group
in Boston. The advocacy group mapped the energy needs of the park and
determined that it would take 11 stationary bicycles pedaled continuously to
replace the generators and fuel seized by authorities. (Source: <a

Adapting to a change in circumstances, the mutual decision-making power of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>On October 27
economist and activist David Korten presented at our Community Forum here at
this Fellowship and expressed his concern that the Occupy movement does not yet
have a unifying story. There is a declaration, with a laundry list of wrongs
ranging from illegal foreclosure processes to weapons of mass destruction.
There is also a unique community. This global community is being created from
lessons learned during the Arab Spring and the 15<sup>th</sup> of May Movement
in Spain. This new way of creating community embraces Collective Thinking.
Collective Thinking takes time and is different from the right/wrong,
confrontational, you win/I lose type of decision making many of us are used to.
The objective of Collective Thinking is creative and constructive. Replacing
confiscated generators with safer bicycle generated electricity is an idea that
arose from Collective Thinking. In the old way of thinking, call it
Confrontational Thinking, we rate ideas and then vote on the best one. Someone
loses or, at best, has to compromise what they thought was the best solution.
In Collective Thinking a new idea comes from actively listening; a new idea
that no one had thought of beforehand, a transformational idea arises
independently from the wisdom of the whole. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>An important
component of the Occupy movement is the General Assembly. The General Assembly
asks all present to participate and decisions are made by consensus. A way of
communicating has been handed from General Assembly to General Assembly across
the movement. The first time members of this congregation participated in
Occupy Thousand Oaks here is what we learned: 1. Agreement is shown with
upraised, open hands moving from side to side, 2. Mild disagreement is shown by
lowering the hands and moving them from side to side, 3. Strong disagreement,
based on moral and ethical reasoning, is shown by arms folded across the chest,
3. Needing clarification, or an answer to a question, is signaled by raising a
hand and moving it above the head and 4. The “mic check” is used when
participants in the back of the group can’t hear what is being said. The group
acts as a human microphone, repeating what has been said until the entire group
is brought into the discussion. The “mic check” has also been used to
peacefully disrupt public meetings like the one recently held by Chicago’s
Union League Club with keynote speaker Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. Walker
was surprised by cries of “Mic Check” from members of Stand Up Chicago and the Chicago
Teacher’s Union who interrupted the meeting with messages from the 99%.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>These signs and
signals vary from group to group across the world as this new language is
shared. Each time a new Occupy group gathers, common signals are agreed upon
and a sub-group of this global language is formed. Each time a new person
joins, signals and signs are shared. A new, constructive, respectful way of
communicating is expected. Blame, prejudice and ideology have no place in
Collective Thinking. The group associates freely; if you do not agree with a
decision that is made then you are free to decline participation in a
particular action.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>On October 28,
the filmmaker Michael Moore, addressing Occupy Oakland said, &quot;We are all
leaders. And we are all followers. We are all doing this together. The media
and the power establishment is having a hard time figuring this out. So, be
patient with them. They are used to just a few people showing up with a few
signs and then they go away and have a meeting in the basement of the Unitarian
Church. God bless the Unitarians, by the way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>On November 2, more
than 7,000 protestors in Oakland joined in a general strike that shut down the
shipping port. Supporters in New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and other
cities staged demonstrations in support of the Oakland movement, which called
for the general strike in response to the earlier incident when the Iraq veteran
had been injured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The general
strike was considered a success with thousands of people participating in an
action of civil disobedience, until violence erupted late during the night. Differing
reports portray the perpetrators of the violence as angry protestors who broke
into an empty building that had once housed a program that aided the homeless.
The program had been dismantled due to budget cuts. Others report that the
violence came from masked intruders, who broke off from the crowd. Those who
occupied the building intend to re-start the homeless program. It is not clear
who started the violence, but it is clear that the majority of protestors in
cities worldwide are calling for peaceful demonstrations. (Source: <a

style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The new,
unifying story of the Occupy movement is being written with each passing day.
Unfortunately, the new story is being told at the same time the old story
refuses to die. The violence that occurred late Wednesday and early Thursday is
the old story. The story we tell about power fighting power with confrontation,
ending with winners and losers. The new, unifying story of the Occupy movement
is struggling to be written with new words: the words that come from Collective
Thinking and peaceful resistance. The old American story is going away - the
one that goes: “I pulled myself up by my bootstraps, why can’t you?” The story
that tells of an America conquered by rugged individualism; the story that
values things over people; the story where the “giant triplets of racism,
materialism and militarism” always win.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The new unifying
story of OccupyWallStreet is emerging out of the experience of the protestors.
It is a story about shared power, power with rather than power over. It is a
story arising from within a grass roots community organizing effort, rather
than a story imposed from outside by a hierarchy led by a privileged class. It
is the story of interdependence. It’s a new story and it is also a very ancient
one. It is a story a lot like the story of Indra’s Magnificent Jeweled Net.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The story of
Indra’s Net comes to us from the Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Indra’s
infinite jeweled net holds dazzling jewels at each crossing point on the net.
The jewels infinitely reflect one another. This is the story of the
interdependent web of all existence. We are each a jewel in this story. As we
look into the shining individual next to us we see ourselves. We are
independent at the same time we are interdependent. This story is often told to
remind us that what one person does in the interdependent web of all existence
affects us all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span lang=EN
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>There is another
element of the story, which may go missing to the Westerner who hears it. The
story is also a reminder to look beyond the surface of reality. While we are
proclaiming we are the 99%, we cannot assume that appearances tell the whole
story. We cannot assume that the woman yelling from her car at protestors, blaming
our president is a racist. We cannot assume that someone who stands on the
corner with us as the 99% votes the same way we do or prays to the same God, or
even prays at all. As the new, unifying story of the Occupy movement arises, it
asks us to go beyond blame, beyond appearances, beyond power over. This new,
unifying story invites us into partnership, into constructing reality here and
now and into a new way of being that allows creative solutions to arise out of
the wisdom of the whole. </span></p>
