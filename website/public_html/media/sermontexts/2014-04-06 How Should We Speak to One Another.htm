<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><b>©
Rev. Lora Brandis</b></p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Preached at Conejo Valley Unitarian Universalist
Fellowship<br>
April 6, 2014</span></b></p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
Sufi poet Rumi wrote, &quot;Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and right-doing,
there is a field. I’ll meet you there. When the soul lies down in that grass,
the world is too full to talk about. Ideas, language, even the phrase each
other doesn’t make any sense.&quot; How should we speak to one another? We
should speak to each other as if there is a field that exists that is beyond right
and wrong. We should speak to each other as if language can carry us to a place
where separation ceases and even the phrase each other doesn’t make any sense.
We should speak to one another as if there is nothing to win and there is much
to gain.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“How
Should We Speak to One Another” is the eighth step from Karen Armstrong’s <i>Twelve
Steps to a Compassionate Life</i>. It is a question rather than a statement. It
is a query rather than a rule. Our Unitarian Universalist faith is guided by a
set of ethical principles sustained by wisdom found in a variety of sources
that religious people throughout the ages have turned to for practical steps in
order to live with integrity. As members of this Fellowship we covenant to
speak honestly and directly to someone with whom we disagree or have a concern.
We assume good intentions and use compassionate language in our exchanges with
each other. Sometimes we fall short, knowing that we can be called back into
covenant to continue to learn how we should and can speak to one another.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Should
– that’s a word that will stop a conversation.  “Should” is our controlling partner
in the “good enough” dance, demanding we should be grateful to be alive, we
should be compassionate, we should be a better person, among other “shoulds” we
do to ourselves and others. There is no one right way to speak to one another.
The eighth step to a compassionate life is a question.  “Live the questions
now,” the poet Rilke reminds us. We are always living our way into the answers.
How should we speak to one another? In a church, shouldn’t we at least be nice
to each other?</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>That
was the naïve assumption I made as an intern minister. Since that time I have
learned that it is better to be kind than to be nice. Nice implies a smile
painted over a seething emotion waiting just below the surface. Kind implies
awareness – a smile learned from deep acknowledgment of what serves the whole.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>While
I was an intern minister I attempted to attend as many committee meetings as
possible, learning not only how the congregation ministered to each other and to
the world at large, but also how the congregation functioned as an emotional
system. One evening I attended a committee meeting that was a potluck at
someone’s home. We gathered and ate for about the first thirty minutes, holding
our plates in our hands mingling with each other until we were called to sit
and begin the meeting. I had met all but one of the committee members in
attendance prior to the meeting. Several of the committee members were fairly
new (within the last year) to the church. Two of those were not new to
Unitarian Universalism. All were not new to church life, or to attending some
sort of a religious community. So what followed may not have surprised them as
much as it did me.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There
was discussion about a particular project that was not supported by the board and
the director of religious education as much as the project chair had hoped it
would be. It was the benign sort of complaining that we have all engaged in
from time to time while being the messy and imperfect beloved community that we
are. And then the conversation took a turn that I had not anticipated. It was
dominated by two people who decided to use part of the agenda to bad- mouth someone
in the congregation. One even joked about her negative opinion about the woman
in question and made mock catfight noises. She laughed and concluded that the
woman had much less musical talent than she, even though she was sure that that
woman thought otherwise. I sat in utter astonishment, with my mouth hanging
open probably, unable to call the conversation back into covenant. How should
we speak to one another? I thought we covenanted with one another to affirm the
worth and dignity of every person and to affirm and promote the interdependent
web of existence. I missed the part where we covenant to hijack a committee
agenda to gossip about the people we don’t like. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
opposite of niceness is not meanness. Niceness fosters a politeness on Sunday
mornings that gives way to true feelings on Saturday evenings. Unless we
acknowledge the anxiety that lurks behind niceness and the pain that is hidden
behind gossip, we will continue to make the same naïve assumptions about
religious institutions that people have been making for centuries. Instead of
James Luther Adams’ proclamation that “church is a place where we get to
practice what it means to be human” we will declare that church is a place
where we get to stay in our old habits and be nice to each other because it’s
too hard to grow and change. The opposite of niceness is awareness.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Family
systems expert Edwin Friedman put it this way: </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt'>Actually religious institutions are the worst offenders
at encouraging immaturity and irresponsibility. In church after church, some
member is passively-aggressively holding the whole system hostage, and no one
wants to fire him or force her to leave because it wouldn’t be “the Christian
thing to do.” It has nothing to do with Christianity. Synagogues also tolerate
abusers because it wouldn’t be the Christian thing to do. </p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;
margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>How
should we speak to one another? How should I have spoken that night at the
meeting so many years ago? At the time I was naïve enough to think that if the senior
minister had been present that perhaps the discussion wouldn’t have turned so
“gossipy” and negative. I was just an intern; I didn’t have any authority. I couldn’t
imagine that some of the comments that were made would have been made in front
of the senior minister. Now that I am a minister I know this isn’t true. We are
human. We can forgive easily the petty sins of our ill-spoken moments. I have
forgiven the two people who turned the conversation so negative that night. I
watched them both serve the congregation with drive and passion. I also know
how one credits the church with saving her daughter’s life. I have forgiven
them. I have not let myself off the hook so easily. When do I not use right
speech? When do I complain instead of take responsibility? When do I allow my
petty feelings to get in the way of constructive work?</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>How
should we speak to one another? Composer Stephen Sondheim advises: “Careful the
things you say. Children will listen.  Careful the spell you cast. Not just on
children. Careful the tale you tell. That is the spell.” </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Karen
Armstrong writes that, “In our highly contentious world, we need to develop a
twenty-first-century form of Socrates’ compassionate discourse” (p. 135). Buddhist
Joseph Goldstein says that “Although there is great elaboration of right speech
in the texts, it all condenses into two general principles: Is it true? Is it
useful?” Driven by a preoccupation with what disconnects some of us from our
compassionate nature and what allows some people to stay connected to their
compassionate nature, psychologist Marshall Rosenberg created Nonviolent
Communication (NVC). NVC is based on the simple principle that “When we focus
on clarifying what is being observed, felt, and needed rather than on
diagnosing and judging, we discover the depth of our own compassion” (location
364).</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It
wasn’t that the toxic speech I experienced at the meeting was damaging for the
community as a whole – it was, but that’s only partially the point – it was
that the negative speech reflected an inner woundedness that kept the speakers
from wholeness. This is the concern of the church. This is the pastoral concern
of the minister: what pain are you hiding behind that nice smile of yours? What
need isn’t being met? </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Marshall
Rosenberg identifies the toxic speech I witnessed that evening as
life-alienating communication. “Our attention is focused on classifying,
analyzing, and determining levels of wrongness rather than on what we and
others need and are not getting,” he writes. Maybe if I had observed what was
going on rather than sitting in stunned silence judging the behavior, I could
have reminded the group of the congregation’s covenant to create a welcoming
space for all to speak their truth respectfully. I could have reminded us all
that when we enter into the covenantal community, we enter into a willingness
to be held accountable whether we are meeting in a social setting or inside the
church walls. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Whether
we practice a twenty-first-century form of Socrates’ compassionate discourse,
the Buddha’s right speech or Nonviolent Communication we can all learn to stop in
mid-sentence, if necessary, and listen to the tales we are telling and how we
are telling them. Marshall Rosenberg also writes that “the more people are
trained to think in terms of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and
badness, the more they are being trained to look outside themselves – to
outside authorities – for the definition of what constitutes right, wrong,
good, and bad” (location 663).</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There
is a story from Genesis that tells of a time when the whole earth was of one
language and of one speech. All of the people gathered together and said, “Let
us build a city and a tower that reaches into the heavens.” Afraid that they
might be scattered throughout the land and someday be forgotten, they wanted to
make a name for themselves. Their god came down from the heavens to see the
city and tower that the mortals had built. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Their
god said, “Look they are one people and they all have one language. They have
begun to build a tower all of the way into the heavens. They will be able to do
whatever it is they imagine they can do.” Maybe their god was afraid of their arrogance
or maybe their god didn’t realize how powerful his creation could be. No matter
the reason, god decided to come down from heaven and confound the people’s
language so that they could no longer understand one another’s speech. God
scattered the people throughout the earth and they stopped building the
magnificent city with the tower that reached outward towards the heavens.
“Therefore it was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of
all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of
all the earth” (Genesis 11:1-9). Like the Garden of Eden story, the tower of
Babel is a folktale of human pride and folly. How dare the creation try to be
like the creator? How arrogant! “How in need of punishment the foolish and
prideful human is,” the judging parent god proclaims.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>There
is another way to understand this folktale. What if the “sin” at the tower of
Babel was not pride? What if humankind’s ongoing mistake is to build an
external monument to an internal truth? “The more people are trained to think
in terms of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the more
they are being trained to look outside themselves – to outside authorities –
for the definition of what constitutes right, wrong, good, and bad.” Unitarian
Universalists have a long history of rejecting external monuments, of rejecting
the idea of worshipping the finger-pointing symbol instead of the eternal truth
to which the symbol points. We are no longer accountable to the old punishing
gods; we choose now to be accountable to each other.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>How
should we speak to one another?  We should (and can) speak to each other as if
there is a field that exists that is beyond right and wrong. We should (and
can) speak to each other claiming our feelings and recognizing our needs. We can
speak to each other consciously, clearly, directly and in covenant. With
compassion and gratitude, we seek not to win the argument but to gain wholeness
for ourselves and the entire human family.</p>
