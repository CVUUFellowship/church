<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I was at my credit union the
other day, and the bank teller casually asked me if I had any plans for the
Memorial Day weekend. I didn’t tell him that I’d be working for some of it;
instead I simply said no, other than maybe going to a movie with a friend. And
then I asked him the same question; and his answer was similar to mine: he
might do some barbecuing with the family, he said, but no big plans.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Of course, I’ve <i>been </i>invited
to <i>lots</i> of places over the weekend: Kohl’s, Macy’s, Coldwater Creek
online – you name it; they’ve assured me that I’ll find bargains like never
before, all in honor of Memorial Day!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          And for anyone who cares
about the rules of fashion, Memorial Day marks the beginning of the season when
we women can wear white accessories; hallelujah! (Actually, I’ve purposely been
wearing white accessories long before this weekend, just to annoy the fashion police!)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Lots of people have taken
off for camping or the beach, including my daughter and her family. And for
those of us who just wish to stay at home, there are several marathons on TV to
binge-watch: “Friday Night Lights,” “Keeping Up with the Kardasians,” and one
called “Hoarding: Buried Alive” – which sounds so intriguing I might just have
to tune in! And of course, there are lots of war movies.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          But there <i>was </i>a time
when Memorial Day carried more weight than simply going out-of-town or taking a
trip to the mall. It began as “Decoration Day” after the end of the Civil War,
and people would visit the cemeteries and place flowers or flags on the graves
of those killed in that war. It was a somber day of remembrance – a time to
mourn the deaths of loved ones – and perhaps even strangers – and feel the
costs of that war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>It wouldn’t be
until after World War I that the holiday would evolve into one honoring <i>all </i>Americans
who fought in a war. But when it began to lose its solemnity and become more
like any other holiday for recreation and merchandizing, I cannot say. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Of course,
there <u>are</u> celebrations this weekend remembering our military – parades,
concerts, memorials at cemeteries in many communities around the country. But
I’ve never taken them very seriously; they’ve felt too patriotic for me – too
much of a celebration of war and a false patriotism, and not enough about the
real costs of those wars, and our yearning for peace. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>So I’ve pretty
much avoided paying this holiday much attention. Most years in churches I’ve
served, I’ve used it as an opportunity for the congregation to honor people in
their lives who have died in the past year. Called “Building an Altar to Life,”
people were invited to bring photos or mementos honoring their deceased loved
ones, and place them on an “altar” created for the occasion; it was always
moving, but had little to do with military deaths.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>When I <i>have
</i>preached the occasional Memorial Day sermon, it’s honored Conscientious
Objectors, or celebrated peacemakers, or protested war; it has not been a
sermon simply paying homage to the soldiers who have died or been severely
wounded while fighting for our country; I have felt too conflicted about them. But
that has changed for me, in large part because of the stories of some of my UU colleagues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Rev. David
Pyle, former assistant minister at the Ventura UU church, also served as a
military chaplain to American soldiers in Bosnia/Herzegovina, El Salvador, and
elsewhere. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>He wrote that
he began sensing the tragedy of war at an early age, as he stood one day with
his father at the Vietnam War Memorial, and saw his father softly crying while
tracing his fingers over the name of someone with whom he’d fought side-by-side
in that war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>A few years
later, Rev. Pyle would question why his grandfather was openly weeping while
staring at an old abandoned bunker on a beach in Hawaii. His mother explained
that his grandfather had lived in that bunker while serving as a sailor during
World War II – had lived, fought, and watched friends die. All those years
later, Rev. Pyle’s grandfather was still carrying those men in his heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>My own family
has been pretty untouched personally by war; I don’t think I’ve known anyone
who was killed or even seriously wounded in one. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>But reading
some of David Pyle’s reflections of his experiences called to my mind moments
when I was suddenly brought into the life of a soldier or their family, and was
opened in a way I hadn’t expected to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Like the year </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>that I
attended a peace rally at the Arlington West exhibit on the beach below the
Santa Monica Pier. It was the first time I’d visited this display of crosses in
the sand, each one representing a soldier who had died in the Iraq or
Afghanistan wars. People were wandering through the aisles, placing flowers on
some of the crosses, as well as slips of paper with a soldier’s name, and
personal messages of love or gratitude or peace. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          Participants in the rally
were asked to carry a flag-draped cardboard box the size and shape of a casket
through the streets of Santa Monica. Another woman and I chose one that had a
photo of a young soldier leaning against it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>As we stood
waiting for instructions, a man came over to us and introduced himself as a
friend of the soldier in the photo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>We stood there
chatting with him, when suddenly his cell phone rang, and it turned out to be
the <u>mother</u> of “our” soldier! After the man spoke to her for a few
minutes, he said, “Here; I’ll let you talk to a couple of the people who will
be carrying Tommy’s casket through the streets of Santa Monica,” and proceeded
to hand the phone to me! I hardly knew what to say. Finally I told her how
honored I was to carry this casket representing her son; and I let her know I
was a minister, and that I would be lighting a candle in her son’s name the
next day at my church. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>She was so
very grateful, and speaking with her – hearing the sorrow <i>and</i> the
gratitude in her voice – brought the depth of her experience alive for me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>I don’t
remember how long it took the crowd at the rally to walk through downtown Santa
Monica, carrying all these symbolic caskets on our shoulders. But as we did, I
began to feel the burden on my shoulders of this young soldier; I could feel
the heaviness of his coffin, and the grief of his death. I was reminded, as my
colleague Barbara Pescan once wrote, that he and all these soldiers belong to
me and to us all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Another time, when members of my
congregation and I had returned to Arlington West to help put away the display
until the next weekend, I found myself standing beside a young Marine as we
awaited our turn to carry a flag-draped cardboard “casket” to the storage area.
I asked him, “How long ago were you in Iraq?” And he answered with great pride
and excitement in his voice, “Oh, I haven’t been yet. I go next year!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I
tell you, I felt as if I’d been stabbed in the heart. I wanted to grab him and
plead with him not to go. I wanted to take him home with me and protect him.
But I couldn’t; all I could say was, “Ahhh…I will think of you” – meaning, “I
will pray for your safety, and that you will have to kill no one.” I have so
often wondered what became of that young man; I can only hope that he’s back
home where he belongs, and that he is well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>          I
do not want to forget these two soldiers – one dead, and one hopefully still
alive; nor do I want to forget their families – that mother’s voice, the
children left behind – the children never even born. Yet too often I do forget.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>“War is the
only form of Hell I believe in,” writes David Pyle; “a Hell existing in this
time, in this world; a Hell of our own making. It is one of the deepest and
most destructive aspects of who we are as a human race,” he contends. And I
think he should know, as he has witnessed the aftermath of war up close.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>He has
witnessed what it does to those who survive the war, but who carry deep wounds
– either physical or emotional – because of the experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>He has
witnessed what it does to the children of war. In one of his Memorial Day
sermons, Rev. Pyle wrote, “When I think of war, I think of children; of the
cycles of violence – of learned helplessness and of power. I think of the
lessons we teach our children – that what we teach them, implicitly and
explicitly, becomes the reality of the world of tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And he has
witnessed what war does to the families of those who fought – of those who
died, and of those who returned wounded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>And because of
all he has witnessed, Rev. Pyle tells us that we should be treating Memorial
Day as a sacred day. “For military folks,” he writes, “it is a day for silent
tears, for touching a wall, for remembering those who served alongside them in
concrete bunkers, and walked through Hell with and for each other. He asks us
to make this <i>not</i> a day of celebration, but a National Day of Remembering
and of Mourning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'> “Place your
arms around our soldiers,” he pleads, “as we weep our silent tears.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>But the true
meaning of this holiday, writes Rev. Pyle, is to remember that the cost of war
is almost always too high. “For those who believe in Peace, who hope for Peace,
who pray for Peace, and who work for Peace…there should be no more sacred day
in the calendar than Memorial Day – a day to remember the cost of war, and to
never, never, <i>never </i>allow that cost to be forgotten.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>My friend and
colleague Rev. Jan Christian, senior minister at the Ventura church, whose
older brother was killed in Vietnam, suggests that one way to truly honor those
who have served in our wars is to simply say “Welcome Home” upon their return,
and to stand “ready to listen to their sorrows, knowing it might take years.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>But both of
these colleagues tell us also that in remembrance of the women and men who walk
through the Hell of war for us – out of love for them and for their families,
and especially for the children everywhere – we must never stop praying and
singing and working for peace, and the justice that walks hand-in-hand with
that peace.  We, as Unitarian Universalists and as patriotic Americans, must do
whatever we can to bring an end to war, and to ensure that those who have
survived our wars, are given the support they need upon their return. As we now
know, our country has fallen far short of such support.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Over 87,000
Americans have died in military combat in my lifetime; and of course, many
thousands more have been severely wounded, both physically and psychically. All
these men and women came from different backgrounds, different circumstances,
carrying different hopes and dreams in their hearts. Most of them were probably
young – in some instances, barely out of high school. Some left behind young
children, and others were looking forward to starting a family. But all of them
died before they should have; each of their lost lives needs to be remembered,
mourned; they must not be forgotten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:"Bookman Old Style","serif"'>Rev. Pyle has
said that he hears the true meaning of Memorial Day in the “prophetic voices”
of the soldiers themselves, imploring us, “Remember me.” So in the silence that
follows, I invite you to call into the sacred space of this Sanctuary the names
of any members of our armed services who you hold in your heart this weekend,
be they living or deceased. May our compassion and gratitude embrace them now.</span></p>
