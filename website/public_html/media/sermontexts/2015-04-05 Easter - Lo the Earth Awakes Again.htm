<h1 style='margin-bottom:6.0pt'><b><i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Reflections
on Passover</span></i></b></h1>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          “When the spirit struck us free we could
scarcely believe it…” writes the activist priest Daniel Berrigan, in his
re-write of Psalm 126. I imagine this was felt by the ancient Israelites as
they found themselves free from the bondage of the Pharoah of Egypt. Their
mouths must have been “filled with laughter,” and their “tongues with pure
joy.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          The story of the exodus from Egypt is
re-told every year at Passover by Jews around the world, be they religious or
secular. This year it began at sundown Friday, and will end at sundown April 11<sup>th</sup>.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          Each year, we are reminded of the terrible
oppression that afflicted the ancient Israelites – how they were forced into
slavery, and how even when Moses went to Pharoah and begged him to free the
people, the Pharoah refused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          And each year, we are reminded of the
miracles their God provided for them – the ten plagues on the land of Egypt to
try to convince the Pharoah to free the Israelites, the “passing over” the
Israelites’ homes to save them from the final plague, and the parting of the
Red Sea to let them escape the Pharoah’s army.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          In the Seder dinners I’ve attended in the
past, the story doesn’t end with the liberation of the ancient Israelites.
Instead, we are asked to remember others in more recent times who have faced
oppression, and have struggled to liberate themselves. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          And we are invited to remember those
individual men and women who, like Moses, answered the call to lead their
people to freedom: Harriet Tubman, Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Rosa Parks, Cesar Chavez, and so many more who worked for freedom behind the
scenes, in small, quiet ways, but without whom those more famous leaders could
not have succeeded. It reminds us of the power that one individual can have,
and invites us to consider ourselves as holding such possibilities.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          And finally, as we remember the story of
Passover, and of all the subsequent liberation movements right up to our own
time, let us not forget the role that religious faith has played. The
Israelites were a community of faith; and it was that faith that allowed them
to move forward in the face of great challenge and fear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          It has been people of faith who have often
challenged the purveyors of hate and fear through history. And still today we
find individuals and congregations, in all faiths – including Unitarian
Universalist – who take up the struggles for justice and liberation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          Passover celebrates the courage of the
ancient Israelites in their journey toward freedom. But it also celebrates the
courage of freedom fighters throughout history, and to make their struggle our
own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=center style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:center;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>*****</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><b><i><u><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>Reflections on Easter</span></u></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          For many the story of Easter is, like that
of Passover, a story of liberation – only in this story, it’s not the
liberation of a whole community of people from oppression, but the liberation
of new life from the tomb of death. And as our Responsive Reading suggests, it
is we who are invited by this story to roll away the stone from our soul, and
move from the grief and sorrow of Good Friday, into the joy and possibilities
of Easter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          My second year of Seminary up in Berkeley
was the hardest one for me. It wasn’t the academics that posed the challenge,
but rather things going on in the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          It was the fall of 1978, and a month or so
after classes began, an airplane crashed over San Diego, killing all on board; it
was the same airline I often flew between Oakland and L.A. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>That was followed a short time later by
the mass suicide at Jonestown – a tragedy that still today causes a visceral
reaction in me. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>And less than ten days after <i>that</i>
event, Harvey Milk and George Moscone were assassinated across the bay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          And for some reason, I decided in the spring
quarter to take a class on the Holocaust, which was – as you might imagine –
the most depressing class I’ve ever experienced. I was wrapped in sadness,
unable to remove from my head the images we were seeing in movies, and reading
in the works of Elie Wiesel and others.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          The final blow was learning that my very
best friend was now romantically involved with my ex-husband; I felt,
rationally or not, completely betrayed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          As the end of the school year approached, I
found myself unable to see joy in much of anything; the laughter that ordinarily
brought me such comfort eluded me; the hope I could so often find seemed a
farce.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          Then one day my advisor, Ron Cook, sat me
down in his office and said, “Hines,” – that’s what he always called me – “you
need to find some way to move from Good Friday to Easter.” I’d never thought of
myself as being stuck in a Good Friday frame of mind, but I realized in that
moment that I had been choosing to remain inside the tomb of my grief, rather
than allowing myself the strength and courage to move aside the stone that had
been locking me in all those months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          Joan Chittister, a writer and activist for
peace and justice, suggests that, “Our struggles begin at those junctures of
life where the past disappears and the future seems unclear or unacceptable; there
is irreparable interruption;” and we may feel defeated and hopeless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          Removing the stone that has blocked out the
light means we must engage the struggle that has confronted us. We never heal
our sorrow or despair by ignoring it’s power, or by rushing the process. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          But the purpose of engaging our struggle –
whatever it happens to be – isn’t to remain there with it, but to allow it to
teach us and transform us. “If we decide to endure to the end,” writes
Chittister, “we come out of it changed by the doing of it. We dare the
development of the Self.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          The story of Good Friday and Easter is one
of death and resurrection – not necessarily of the body, but rather the soul.
And it assures us that no matter how bleak our world may appear, that courage
and love will be our companions – sometimes in the form of people who love us,
sometimes in the form of our inner wisdom, and sometimes in the form of
whatever it is that we might call God. But that courage and love is always
within our reach, rising like the first signs of Spring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText align=center style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:center;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>*****</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;line-height:normal'><b><i><u><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>The
Hope of Spring</span></u></i></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          A happier memory of mine from Seminary (and
there are many) is the adaptation several of us created one year of the ancient
story of Demeter and her beautiful daughter, Persephone, and of course the
wretched Hades, god of the Underworld! (I got to play the part of Persephone,
which, as I recall, simply involved a lot of screaming!)</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          I suspect that most of you are familiar with
the story. Demeter and Persephone are living a life of bliss, when one day
Hades captures Persephone and drags her off to the Underworld. Demeter is so
distraught as she searches for her daughter, that she causes everything on
earth to stop growing. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Finally the god Hermes descends into
hell and convinces Hades to let Persephone return to earth. But Hades tricks
Persephone into still having to return to him for a part of every year; hence
the seasons of Winter – when Demeter’s grief prevents any growth, and Spring –
when her joy at Persephone’s return causes the dormant seeds to burst open again
with new life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>It is no coincidence that both Passover
and Easter occur near the onset of Spring, for they both speak of new life, of
new possibilities, of freedom and wholeness and transformation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          And it is no surprise that so many Unitarian
Universalist churches in America choose this time of year to honor one of our
Unitarian “saints” – Norbert Capek, a Unitarian minister in </span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;color:#1C1C1C'>Czechoslovakia</span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'> who was an outspoken critic of Hitler; he was also a
well-loved pastor to his people.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          The story <i>I </i>learned is that on his
birthday one year, his parishioners surprised him by bringing flowers to adorn
the Chancel – just as you have done this morning. He in turn surprised <i>them </i>by
blessing the flowers, and then inviting everyone forward to take a flower home
with them. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>          In 1941 Rev. Capek was arrested by the
Gestapo and thrown into Dachau, where he was tortured and, in 1942, put to
death. But the story of his courage and his love of justice could never die. It
is told year after year, as the Flower Communion he began is re-enacted in our
churches in memory of him. He reminds us of the power of love, and of the hope
that we hold out for the future every time we speak for justice, and act in
faith.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:
inter-ideograph;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>          When
we are wrestling with hopelessness over the state of our country or the world, we
need the model of the Israelites and all the other justice-seekers since to
give us courage.</span></p>

inter-ideograph;line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>          When
