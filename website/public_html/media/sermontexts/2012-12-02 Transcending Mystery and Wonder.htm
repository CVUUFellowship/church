<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Unitarian Universalism draws from many sources. The first
one we name is “Direct experience of that transcending mystery and wonder,
affirmed in all cultures, which moves us to a renewal of the spirit and an
openness to the forces which create and uphold life.” As I have walked towards
this week’s theme I have walked with Mr. Henry David Thoreau through the woods
near Walden Pond, into the mystery and wonder found in nature. To do this I
first needed to find my copy of <i>Walden</i>, tucked away somewhere in the
chaos of my library that lives between the church and my home office. Before I
found my copy of <i>Walden</i> I was mysteriously compelled to clean out my
magazine rack, which holds not only magazines needing to be recycled but also
travel brochures and old coffee table books placed there shortly after I
unpacked from my move. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In a mini-experience of mystery and wonder, I found <i>In
Wildness Is the Preservation of the World</i>, a book of photographs by Eliot
Porter specifically chosen to go with selected writings of Thoreau. I had no
recollection of owning this book. It is one of those inherited treasures that I
discover from time to time, something from my mother’s book shelves hastily
thrown into a box when I went through her belongings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Published in 1962 by the Sierra Club, <i>In Wildness Is the
Preservation of the World</i> is a warning from fifty years ago that if we are
to preserve our world “we need to witness our own limits transgressed, and some
life pasturing freely where we never wander” (<i>Walden</i>). These are
Thoreau’s words from <i>Walden </i>written in 1854. He also wrote: “At the same
time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all
things be mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild,
unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In other words, there are places we can leave to mystery.
There are moments filled with wonder that do not need to be explained away with
overthinking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The discovery of a book pairing ground breaking photography
from the 1960s with wisdom from our transcendentalist past is not the great
mystery I would like it to be. There is a scientific explanation for my bizarre
urge to clean out my magazine rack on that particular day. The explanation can
be found in the mammalian part of my brain known as the reticular activating
system. The reticular activating system, or RAS, is responsible for many
functions, but it caught the attention of cognitive psychologists and
motivational coaches about thirty years ago because of attention. The RAS is
believed to control sleep, wakefulness, and the ability to consciously focus
attention on something. In addition, it acts as a filter so that the senses
won’t be overloaded by stimuli. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I may have known that I owned a book with selections of
Thoreau’s writings, but I didn’t need to carry this information with me all of
the time. The RAS helped me to filter out unneeded thoughts when I “forgot”
about this book that resided in my magazine rack. And then it functioned again to
focus my attention on the magazine rack when I decided to take a walk this week
with the words of Henry David Thoreau.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The reticular activating system is the science behind all
of those cognitive psychologists, motivational coaches and New Age gurus who
advise that we can become successful by focusing on success. The RAS helps us
see what we want to see. The RAS helps us create our own reality. When we focus
our thoughts on what we want, on what we want to achieve, all we will see will
be related to our passions, values and beliefs. </span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>If we focus our thoughts on what we don’t want, what we
think is inevitable, on what we fear will happen; all we will see will be
related to our fears, lack and disbelief. So much for mystery and wonder and my
magical discovery of a book that offered me an experience of what I thought was
the transcendent. I focused my thoughts on <i>Walden </i>and Henry David
Thoreau. My reticular activating system did its job and pointed me towards the
magazine rack. A scientific explanation prevailed. Mystery and wonder would
have to wait for another day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“What I know I could put into a pack as if it were bread
and cheese, and carry it on one shoulder, important and honorable, but so
small!” – writes the poet Mary Oliver. I happen to know about the reticular
activating system. This knowledge, so small and honorable, reminds me to
respect the rationalist strain in our Unitarian Universalist heritage. It also
reminds me to respect the mystics in our tradition like Ralph Waldo Emerson who
said, “Has the naturalist or chemist learned his craft, who has explored the
gravity of atoms and the elective affinities, who has not yet discerned the
deeper law whereof this is only a partial or approximate statement, namely,
that like draws to like….(“Circles)? Emerson the mystic, explaining the action
of the reticular activating system before scientists claimed it as truth.
Emerson the philosopher, daring us all to speak from a “life passed through the
fire of thought.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>As Unitarian Universalists our theological exploration
begins with direct experience of the kind that Emerson had when he was
discerning deeper laws, describing nature and clothing mystery and wonder with
words that sometimes illuminate truth and, quite frankly, sometimes shroud
mystery with more mystery. Thoreau is simpler. We walk with him into his
“solitudes, where the problem of existence is simplified.” We <u>want</u> to
walk with him into the natural world and meet his “grand, serene, immortal,
infinitely encouraging, though invisible, companion” (<i>Journal</i> edition of
1906). We find comfort from his simple living that finds mystery and wonder at
every turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Today is the first day of Advent on the Christian calendar.
Hanukkah starts Saturday. This is the season of mystery and wonder. Rather than
try to overthink the miraculous in a virgin birth or a one-day supply of lamp
oil lasting for eight days, Unitarian Universalists come to this time each year
with a yearning to make sense of the symbol of light in the darkest part of the
year. We come to this time of year yearning for an experience of the
transcendent – that which takes us out of our small selves into a sense of
connection and awe, an experience of renewal, a feeling of openness to that
which creates and uplifts. We come to this time of year seeking mystery and
wonder with the hope that it will comfort us in the way Thoreau was comforted
by his solitary woodland living.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>On this day when there are only 23 shopping days left until
Christmas, we can look to the symbols of the season for mystery and wonder. On
this day, with Halloween, Thanksgiving and “Black Friday” behind us, (not to
mention “Cyber Monday” and now “Giving Tuesday”) on this day we can come to
church to catch our breath and look forward to our reward for surviving it all:
Christmas Day. Here’s a warning: without mystery and wonder Christmas Day
becomes just another excuse for conspicuous consumption.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This morning many Christian churches, indeed many Unitarian
Universalist churches, are lighting the first candle in the advent ritual with
these words from Isaiah, Chapter 60: “For darkness shall cover the earth, and
thick darkness the peoples.” These words are recited as a reminder of the
cycles of despair and hope that have marked human history. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The writer of these verses from Isaiah offered hope to the
people of Israel who had just returned from exile in 539 BCE. The return to
Jerusalem had not been as successful as the people had hoped; there was
economic oppression, poverty and famine. And yet the writer offers light in the
darkness, a light that ultimately could come from the nation of Israel itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Quoting from Isaiah and the Hebrew Scriptures to celebrate
a Christian ritual often becomes problematic. Not everything in Isaiah points
to the birth of Jesus as the Messiah, as was once assumed. Isaiah 7:14 is the
most problematic of all when it comes to Jesus’ birth. Some of you probably
already know this, but it bears repeating. Understanding what happened to Isaiah
when it was translated from Hebrew into the Greek, is an important piece of our
message to our family and friends at this time of year when we may find
ourselves explaining who we are in an American religious landscape that is
marred by a defensive “war on Christmas” and a primal urge to shop until we
drop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Isaiah 7:14 is an answer to a request for a prophecy. The
prophecy is this: “the young woman is with child and shall bear a son, and
shall name him Immanuel.” The Hebrew word for young woman used in this
particular passage, can refer to a virgin, but there is actually another word
in Hebrew that more specifically means virgin. Unfortunately when the original
Hebrew was translated into Greek the word <i>parthenos </i>was used, which
cannot be translated other than as the word virgin. In the translation of one
small word, a doctrine can be created.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Today most scholars agree that Isaiah was not predicting a
miraculous birth to take place seven hundred years after the prophet first
spoke these words. Isaiah is, in some ways, stating the obvious: the birth of a
child is always a sign for hope, a sign that the future is always contained in
the present. Hope always moves us forward, even when it feels like all we can
do is stand still and wait.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I’ve rushed too far ahead in the story, though, it’s not
Christmas yet. We have only just arrived at the First Sunday in Advent. Advent
is from Adventus, which is Latin for coming towards. Christmas is coming
towards us at a pace we cannot control. Today we celebrate mystery and wonder. Today
we walk into the darkness together, with humility, knowing that we don’t know
everything. Knowing that there is something beyond knowing that keeps calling
us forward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Alone on the mountain trails and on the concrete sidewalks
of life, even in a gloomy, misty day, when most would stay inside in the
comfort of habit, we look to ourselves for this annual turning from darkness to
light. We once again feel connected to the great mystery that transforms from
old to new. We stare at the stars in wonder waiting for our own uncommon life
to be born. What we value we are becoming. What we don’t know will teach us
humility. What is beyond knowing will call us to our better selves. We come to
our solitude with the companions of our tradition, fellow rational mystics all.
Emerson, Thoreau, Fuller, the divine being sitting next to us in worship. We
let go of the unessential and see things as they are, mysterious and wonderful.
Would that we could walk every day out of the darkness of our ego selves into
the light of our true selves, always waiting to be born. Wishing to forget the
mundane pain of our everyday lives, we walk out into the solitude of mystery
and wonder. We can find this stillness and solitude in nature. We can also find
it in the quiet times, the moments at rest. Walking in the landscape here, past
birds of paradise in full bloom and past the lights of the season. Walking past
inflated snowmen, penguins and reindeer. Walking past Santa Claus standing next
to manger scenes. We can even find mystery and wonder in the plastic, the
commercial, the supposedly secular of the season. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We no longer experience mystery and wonder like our
ancestors did. We move towards darkness this time each year knowing that the
days will eventually lengthen, light will return. Even so, we can find mystery
and wonder in the bits of wildness that remain: the falling leaves, the
coyote-sighting on an early morning walk, the starkness of the night sky. There
are places we can leave to mystery. There are moments filled with wonder that
do not need to be explained away with overthinking. We need only look within to
open to the mystery and wonder that is always waiting to be born.</span></p>
