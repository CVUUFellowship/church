Night Journey</b></p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><b>©
Rev. Lora Brandis</b></p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>Preached at Conejo Valley Unitarian Universalist
Fellowship<br>
May 25, 2014</span></b></p>

<p align=center style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Muhammad’s
Night Journey reverses the typical pattern from Arabic poetry that depicts the
poet embarking on a night journey and returning joyfully to his tribe. The
Prophet Muhammad’s journey to Jerusalem and his Ascension to Heaven describe an
archetypal truth rather than a factual truth. It is a journey beyond ego to
reunification with the whole human family. It is a journey toward concern for
everybody.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It
is a story that, as a Christian raised in a culture dominated by stories from
the Hebrew and Christian Bibles, I do not know well. It is a story that, as a
Unitarian Universalist minister educated in a liberal Christian seminary, I do
not draw upon to inform my own faith journey. I am familiar with the story of
the Hijrah – the flight of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina to
escape persecution. I am familiar with some of the stories from Muhammad’s life
including how he was orphaned at a young age and raised at first by his
grandfather and then by his uncle. I know that it is said that he encountered
the Angel Gabriel in a cave and received the words of the Quran directly from
God, that his wife Khadija – a strong and independent business woman – was the
first person to convert and is known as the mother of Islam. And I know the
headlines of Muslim extremists as terrorists. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I
did not know that there is a story from the tradition of Muhammad’s Night
Journey, a mystical experience of the Prophet that is referred to in the Quran
and given more detail in the oral tradition about Muhammad’s life. In the
journey, Muhammad travels to Jerusalem – the holy city of the Jews and
Christians – where he leads the great prophets of the past in prayer. He then
ascends through the seven heavens where he speaks to God, who gives Muhammad
instructions to take back to the faithful regarding the details of prayer. This
story is one of the most important underlying establishments of belief behind
Islam. The founding of this new religion included a physical, psychological and
emotional break from the tribal ego of the past. Muhammad’s Night Journey gives
context to the Sufi mystics like Rumi who wrote:  “Not Christian or Jew or
Muslim, not Hindu, Buddhist, sufi, or zen. Not any religion or cultural system.
I belong to the beloved, have seen the two worlds as one and that one call to
and know, first, last, outer, inner, only that breath breathing human being.”  </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Cordoba
was the capital city of Al-Andalus, a medieval Islamic state that included most
of what is now Spain, Portugal and part of Southern France. Cordoba was the
capital during a time known as “La Convivencia” or the co-existence, a time
when Muslims, Christians and Jews lived in relative peace. With this rich
history in mind, Imam Feisal proposed that a Islamic Community Center known as
“Cordoba House” be built in lower Manhattan just two blocks away from the World
Trade Center site. Imam Feisal dreamed that a center to promote interfaith
dialogue could embody a shared history of co-existence and could also reflect
the pluralistic promise of America.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Instead,
Cordoba House stirred up controversy and prejudice rather than cooperation and
co-existence. Part of the community center was to have been set aside for a
large auditorium to accommodate Muslim prayer and so the project became known
as the “Ground Zero Mosque.” Now, a few years after the media storm and public
protests have faded, the project has been renamed Park51, a less evocative name
that simply reflects the building’s address, and Imam Feisal has been removed
as the chief spokesman and fund raiser. There are no longer plans to create a
center to promote interfaith dialogue. The current project developer would like
to someday tear down the existing building and create a museum of Islamic
culture. Meanwhile, the space was opened to the public with an exhibit that
featured 160 portraits of immigrant children living in New York. A small
carpeted prayer room is located in the lower level.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eboo
Patel, founder and president of Interfaith Youth Core, writes that “The
strangest part of the Cordoba House debate for me was the idea of sacred
ground. The people opposed to Cordoba House insisted that the blocks around
Ground Zero constituted a holy area…. I believe every inch of America is
sacred, from sea to shining sea” (p. xxviii). </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Driving
to the high desert this past Thursday to meet with men held in Adelanto
Detention Center I thought of Eboo Patel’s words. We were about to meet with
four men who were being held by ICE, our government’s immigration and customs
enforcement agency, to let them know they have friends in the outside world.
Two of the four are seeking asylum. Both of the asylum-seekers are from African
countries and both are Muslim.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We
drove through the holy land of the high desert, noticing the beautiful sea of
yucca in bloom along our way. Eboo Patel believes we make America holy “by who
we welcome and by how we relate to each other.” He quotes the Qur’an: “We made
you different nations and tribes that you may come to know one another.” Patel
continues to believe in a vision of America as holy even though we build false
oases in the desert to house those who would be welcomed. Patel’s Islam teaches
him to have concern for everybody. Patel’s faith teaches him that pluralism is
possible. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Eboo
Patel points out that Harvard University scholar Diana Eck makes a key
distinction between diversity and pluralism: “diversity is simply the fact of
people from different backgrounds living in close quarters” he writes (p. 70). Pluralism
is the intentional commitment to make diversity work. Patel’s Interfaith Youth
Core was created to make diversity work by creating a society built on mutual
respect for people’s religious identities, constructive relationships between
people of different religions and “common action for the common good” (p. 71). </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>As
Unitarian Universalists we pride ourselves on being the religion that affirms
there are many paths to the holy, but when it comes to Islam few of us walk that
particular path. We identify as UU Christians, UU Jews, UU Buddhists, UU
Pagans, humanists and atheists. We have yoga practices and meditation practices
and create rituals that follow the cycles of the seasons. Few of us identify as
UU Muslims. Our religion has its roots in the Abrahamic religions -
Christianity, Judaism and Islam – but I believe we know less about Islam than
we do about the other two Abrahamic faiths. We know in our minds that all
religions are to be respected, but in our hearts we still doubt.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It
is commonsense to conclude that the more experience you have with people of
other faiths, the more you are able to see the individual behind the belief. It
is also commonsense to conclude that if you are educated about other religious
traditions that the knowledge gained will help you to develop tolerance and
even compassion for those whose practices are different from your own. It is
not only experience and information that matter, however. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A
recent Gallup Poll makes it clear that what type of experience you have and
what type of information you know make the most difference for interfaith
interactions. From Patel’s book <i>Sacred Ground</i>: “According to a recent
Gallup Poll, only 2 percent of Americans say they have a great deal of
knowledge about Buddhism, and 14 percent report feeling some prejudice towards
Buddhists. Meanwhile, only 3 percent of Americans claim they have a great deal
of knowledge about Islam, yet 43 percent claim some prejudice towards Muslims.
(p. 78).</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Even
as liberal religionists we are subjected to the images of Islam as violent. We
quote Rumi and invite liberal Muslims to share our pulpits, but we don’t know
all the stories or have an exact definition for terms like “sharia,” “dawa,”
and “taqiyya” so that we can counter anti-Islamic sentiment. In contrast, many
of us understand Buddhist terms like metta, karma and bodhisattva. To be good
interfaith partners, it is time for us to have encounters and knowledge that
help us stand up to the 43 percent of Americans who claim some prejudice
towards Muslims.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Dawa
</i>is a concept that promotes education about Islam. It is not, as purveyors
of Islamophobia would have us believe, a concept that promotes Islamic
domination. <i>Taqiyya</i> is a little-used practice that allows Muslims to
hide their true motives if someone wishes them harm. It is not a core belief
that requires Muslims to always lie and hide their true intentions. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>“Sharia
</i>translates as ‘the path to a watering place.’” According to Patel, “In a
religious context, the term refers to various abstract values like the
importance of life, religion, and education as well as more practical matters
dealing with prayer times and funeral rites” (p. 49). Sharia has counterparts
in Catholic and Jewish teachings. For example, Catholics have their own way of
applying what they consider to be moral law when it comes to life matters such
as abortion and divorce. Jewish religious law, known as Halacha, is similar to
sharia<i> </i>in that it governs how Jews believe and behave as Jews under
Jewish religious law. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sharia
is not just about the high profile cases of women being killed for adultery, even
if these horrifying acts are often the first image that comes to mind for many
of us when we hear the term. The path to a watering place – imagery from a
desert bound people who know what it is to thirst. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“The
journey of love is a very long journey, but sometimes with a sigh you can cross
the vast desert,” wrote the Muslim poet and philosopher Muhammad Iqbal. The two
Muslim men we met with this week crossed more than vast deserts to present
themselves at our country’s border, only to be immediately handcuffed and taken
into custody. </p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A
post-911 America is not kind to asylum-seekers, especially to Muslims.
Understandably we are afraid; we are cautious. The Tsarnaev brothers, who are
suspected of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombings, were Chechen Muslims.
Granted asylum, the older brother was a permanent US resident at the time of
the bombings.  Dzhokhar, the younger brother, became a naturalized citizen just
seven months prior to the bombings. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Out
of our fear we are building false oases in the desert, creating diverse
communities of immigrants from Congo, Ghana, El Salvador, Mexico, Honduras,
Jamaica and a host of other countries. Diversity is simply the fact of people
from different backgrounds living in close quarters, we are told. Pluralism is
the intentional commitment to make diversity work. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>If
all of America is sacred ground, then the cramped quarters of an immigrant
detention center is just as holy as the rest of our country. The promise of
America waits in unexpected places, made holy by who we welcome and how we
relate to each other. The promise of America waits for us to affirm and extend
an invitation beyond ego to reunification with the whole human family.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>One
of the men I met with was from war-torn Congo. He told the story of his journey
which, in his words, included much walking, walking, walking, and suffering,
suffering, suffering. He walked across Africa, travelled to Europe and then on
to Brazil, up through South and Central America on to Mexico where he presented
himself at the border seeking asylum and he was immediately handcuffed and
taken into custody.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Hoping
to lighten his mood, I asked him if he’d been outside yet last Thursday when we
visited and if he knew that it was raining.  While we were locked inside for
our first visit it had started to rain and each time a visitor emerged into the
waiting room there was a shared exclamation of “It’s raining!” </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
man from Congo had not seen the rain that day, but he wanted me to know the
story of Moses wandering in the desert with the people complaining about the
lack of rain. Three times they sent Moses to God to ask for rain and still, no
rain. The third time that Moses came back to the people from God a voice arose
from the crowd saying, “It’s me. I am the one who has sinned. I am the one who
is broken and made mistakes in my past.” The skies opened. It rained. The man
was forgiven. The healing could begin. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Now,
every time it rains I will know that someone somewhere has been forgiven.
Someone somewhere is being healed and welcomed back into our human family.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We
need rain. We need forgiveness. This journey beyond ego to reunification with
the whole human family is a long one. This journey toward concern for everybody
is a long one. “The journey of love is a very long journey, but sometimes with
a sigh you can cross the vast desert.”</p>
