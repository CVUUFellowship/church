src="/media/sermontexts/2012-10-21%20Holy%20Imagination_files/image001.gif" align=left hspace=12>This
is the photo of Balpreet Kaur that was taken and then posted to the web site
Reddit, without her knowledge. Reddit is a social news web site where
registered users submit content either as images or words for others to rate.
Viewers’ ratings determine where the post is placed on either the front page of
the site or in subcategories on the site. This photo was placed by a Reddit
user in the subcategory labeled “Funny” with this caption: “I’m not sure what
to conclude from this.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Internet being what it is – our daily reminder
of the interdependent web of all existence of which we are a part – a “funny”
thing did in fact occur. The girl from the picture responded. Her friends had
seen the post, re-posted it on Facebook and then Balpreet responded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She explained how her religion reveres the body as a
sacred gift given by the Divine Being. To alter her body would be to reject the
gift and to separate herself from the Divinity within her. “By transcending
societal views of beauty, I believe that I can focus more on my actions,” wrote
Balpreet Kaur, teaching the Reddit poster and the rest of us, a different
definition of beauty.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And then another “funny” thing happened. The
original poster responded: “I know that this post ISN'T a funny post but I felt
the need to apologize to the Sikhs, Balpreet, and anyone else I offended when I
posted that picture… It was an incredibly rude, judgmental, and ignorant thing
to post” (<a

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We are taught that beauty is in the eye of the
beholder. How we see this picture of Balpreet Kaur teaches us to see beauty
from the perspective of a devout Sikh woman who values action over appearance. Balpreet’s
appearance is a radical act in a world that values appearance over action, a
world that values decoration over beauty.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Beauty is usually not one of those religious words
that we think of as being divisive like God or salvation. Yet, even beauty,
like God and salvation or truth and justice, is subject to interpretation. Even
the word beauty forces us to engage in a respectful dialogue that honors the
“other’s” culture, religion and personal story. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><img width=397 height=210
src="/media/sermontexts/2012-10-21%20Holy%20Imagination_files/image002.jpg" align=left hspace=12>We
are increasingly becoming a world that communicates in images rather than
words. Take, for example, a quick search of the word beauty on Google images.
The search brings up mostly women and then mostly women using “beauty”
products. In this clipped image, taken from hundreds of items that came up from
the search, there is one image that can be considered sacred or religious. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><img width=210 height=210
src="/media/sermontexts/2012-10-21%20Holy%20Imagination_files/image003.gif" align=left hspace=12>This
is a photo of the Rayonnant Rose Window in Notre Dame in Paris. In the Gothic
style, this window would have been created as a way to experience the “light of
God.” Its inherent beauty assumed to have directly come from an experience of
the divine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Trey Ratcliff, a travel photographer who “love(s)
using technology to create beautiful things” recently wrote an essay on the
universal language of images. I read this essay eager for an answer to the
challenging conversation we have entered into this year with theological words
such as covenant, forgiveness, beauty, evil, God, grace and more. As we develop
our language of faith as Unitarian Universalists we bump into walls of misused
words that many of us have rejected and stubbornly refuse to revisit. The
conversation we have among ourselves is difficult enough, unfortunately creating
barriers to how we describe our faith to others in a multi-faith world. The
conversation we have with outside faiths becomes almost impossible as we seek
common ground with words that hold multiple meanings, depending on who is
speaking. Wouldn’t it be so much easier if there were universal images that conveyed
the same thing to all people across the globe?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This is Ratcliff’s thesis: “Imagery is a universal
language that has no borders and describes truths and stories that all humans
can recognize” (<a
href="http://www.facebookstories.com/stories/1937/essay-a-universal-language-of-images">http://www.facebookstories.com/stories/1937/essay-a-universal-language-of-images</a>).
He asks us to imagine a world that developed without written words, one that
developed instead with a device capable of capturing images. In this imaginary
world, everyone easily creates images to communicate concepts and stories. This
is a much more efficient way to communicate in his view. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He is passionate about this way of communicating, a
way that is not so hard to imagine given that many of us now have cameras we
hold in our hands every day. This is a revolution equivalent to the invention
of the printing press. Only now we don’t need a printing press to instantly
share an image captured of a beautiful sunset, a loved one’s smile, or the
arresting appearance of a stranger. “Billions of people now have a totally new
way to communicate, and we will all discover this new visual literacy
together,” Ratcliff writes. “Now, finally, our ideas and thoughts and feelings
and stories can effortlessly travel across borders, cultures, and time,” he rather
naively concludes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><img width=301 height=164
src="/media/sermontexts/2012-10-21%20Holy%20Imagination_files/image004.gif" align=left hspace=12>The
other “funny,” as in peculiar, part of Balpreet Kaur’s photo can be seen in the
logo emblazoned on the t-shirt she is wearing. One might even call this
beautiful, rather than “funny” or peculiar. The Better Together t-shirt is from
Interfaith Youth Core (IFYC), an organization that focuses on storytelling and
engagement between different faiths. Balpreet has attended the Interfaith
Leadership Institutes of IFYC, the Chicago-based organization that trains
college students nationwide to be interfaith leaders. She also mentors other
student interfaith leaders as a coach with IFYC. In contrast to the
photographer’s conclusion that we will develop a universal language using only
images, Balpreet’s story strongly illustrates the power of the spoken and
written word. It takes words to understand this image. It takes Balpreet’s
words stating, “I believe there is no difference between a man and me. Just as
a Sikh man, I too can adorn myself with a turban, choose to keep my hair, and
live by the same discipline and love of the scriptures” (<a
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/balpreet-kaur/turning-ugliness-into-beauty-through-interfaith-leadership_b_1943244.html#slide=more255107">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/balpreet-kaur/turning-ugliness-into-beauty-through-interfaith-leadership_b_1943244.html#slide=more255107</a>).
</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We need Balpreet’s words to understand her
experience of inner beauty because of her radical expression that resists
conventional images of outer beauty. Ultimately beauty is in the eye of the
beholder. We choose to experience beauty when we step outside of the confines
of a depleted imagination fed on stereotypes and prejudice.  We choose to see
beauty when we use our imaginations in a holy and creative manner. Immersing
ourselves in beauty, art and creativity becomes a spiritual practice that takes
us out of our small selves into the realm of higher purpose and deeper insight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><img width=304 height=213
src="/media/sermontexts/2012-10-21%20Holy%20Imagination_files/image005.gif" align=left hspace=12>“What
would happen if I heeded the admonitions of beauty?” the poet Baron Wormser
asks. What <u>would</u> happen if we heeded the admonitions of beauty? First of
all we would balance our need to be analytical with an appreciative mind. We
would balance our left and right brains. We would slow down, “take the time to
drive to a pond and spend an hour watching swans” (Wormser). We would look out
the window, past all of the debates, the to-dos and the “shoulds,” and we would
notice the snow, or the ocean, or the color of the sky. We would appreciate the
spaces in between, the spaces given to us each day out of a beauty that knows
no direction and has nothing to accomplish.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>German liberation theologian Dorothee Soelle wrote about
these spaces in between from a life experience steeped in social activism. In
contemplating the couplet: <i>The rose has no why; it blooms because it blooms.
It notes not itself, asks not if it be seen</i>, Soelle wrote, “For what is
beautiful is holy all by itself.” She also wrote that, “For many years I have
been engaged in the peace movement, and the question I am asked most often is,
of course, the one about success: What is the point of it all? But I have come
to realize that any thinking that is oriented solely toward success is
essentially cynical. For the rose has no why, and one has to do some things,
even when they meet with no success now.” (<i>The Rose Has No Why</i> by
Dorothee Soelle)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I am often asked how we can keep going when there is
still so much to be done. We can surround ourselves with beauty. This is not to
say that we embrace attachment and materialism, this is to say that we surround
ourselves with the beauty of the natural world and the beauty that we find in
our social justice efforts. We can become the artists of our own lives.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Julia Cameron created a tool for this about twenty
years ago called the artist date. The basic idea is to take a consistent block
of time, perhaps two hours a week, to nurture your inner artist, to surround
yourself with beauty. The majority of us don’t even think of ourselves as being
creative at all. Haunted by kindergarten teachers admonishing us to color
within the lines and tortured by memories of being shamed publicly for compositions
badly written, songs sung off-key and stick-figures awkwardly drawn, many of us
pit our intellectual self against our feeling self. The left brain wins and the
right brain is only for creative types. Beauty does not only belong to those
who create it. Beauty also belongs to those who appreciate it. Julia Cameron’s
artist date is designed as a spiritual practice for those of us too busy
fretting, planning, texting, instant messaging, Facebooking, working, child
rearing, complaining about balanced budgets, losing sports teams, foreign
policies, lost debates, won debates, upcoming elections, traffic…too busy to
notice the beauty in the spaces in between.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We can “see the world in a grain of sand, and a
heaven in a wildflower,” as the poet William Blake would have us do, when we
share in the divine power of creation that emanates through beauty into our
open hearts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><img width=288 height=193
src="/media/sermontexts/2012-10-21%20Holy%20Imagination_files/image006.gif" align=left hspace=12>It
might be easier if there were universal images that conveyed all of the
religious words we are exploring together this year. The language of faith is
far more complex. Research does show that facial expressions are universally
interpreted. A smile is a smile in any language. Balpreet Kaur’s smile requires
words to tell its whole story, its holy story.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We are a people of the word and because of our
Puritan roots we rely heavily on word and space stripped of symbol. We are
suspicious of word and worship space highly decorated, suspicious of being
emotionally manipulated. We have also been hurt by well-meaning teachers and
critical parents. Our impulse to create, to beautify has been thwarted. We
grade ourselves and each other on a surface performance of acts meant to
please. The spiritual practice of noticing beauty, appreciating the story
behind the smile, connects us to each other and the ongoing act of creation in
deep soul-satisfying ways.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The realm of worship was once also the realm of the
creative arts: sanctuaries were painted with bold frescoes and adorned with
stained glass windows. The roots of contemporary commercial drama go back to
liturgical drama that was a regular part of the worship experience. And of
course the tradition of sacred music still crosses over from worship into
majestic concert halls.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As we leave our Puritan practices in the past and as
more of our congregations incorporate the arts into worship, our over-emphasis
on the rational becomes balanced with appreciative mind. Temporary art
installations grace our once-plain walls. Dramatic performances re-enter the
sacred space. Liturgical dance, celebratory music…beauty resides alongside our
precious word.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“Inside you there’s an artist you don’t know about….
Say yes quickly, if you know, if you’ve known it from the beginning of the
universe.” (Jalai ud-Din Rumi) Say yes to being the artist of your own life.
Say yes to beauty. Say yes to your own holy imagination. Say yes and Amen and
may it be so.</p>
