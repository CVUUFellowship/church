<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>When was it that the phrase “It is What it Is” became our
catch-all phrase in response to suffering? It seems to have seeped into our
language like “like,” “you know” and my favorite, “yeah, no.” Listen carefully
to the next conversation you have with a friend experiencing loss, heartache or
temporary troubles. Habitually, one of you will say, at some point in the
conversation: “it is what it is.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This pseudo-philosophy we have collectively adopted signifies
our willingness to get comfortable with the notion that objects have their own
distinct nature. This circumstance is a fact distinct from what we think of it,
where we think it will take us, distinct from how we think it will turn out.
This can be productive when our minds want to rush ahead to the conclusion. “It
is what it is” reminds us to stay here now, allowing the present to be what it
is. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In response to suffering, “it is what it is” can be a sort
of “there, there” pat on someone’s arm in the absence of something better to
say. Yes, my suffering is what it is and that “isness,” that distinct nature,
is painful. Acknowledging “it is what it is” is not an invitation to denial of
gut-wrenching feelings. It is an invitation to respond to life’s tragic
surprises with a willingness to fully inhabit this moment now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In <i>If You’re Lucky Your Heart Will Break</i> James
Ishmael Ford writes, “As I experience it all, it seems we are all part of a
great current flowing from some unknown source to some unknown end, like a
river on its way to an ocean. All we know with anything even approaching
certainty is this moment itself. And we need to notice what we find here….”
Rev. Ford is a Zen priest and a Unitarian Universalist minister. The two
traditions complement each other, he assures us. The one offering a method to
explore what it is to be human; the other offering a reminder that reason and
rationality always inform his exploration.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Steeped in forty years of Zen, guided by a rational liberal
religious tradition, Rev. Ford recommends a deep agnosticism. This deep
agnosticism is not a response to a question about belief in god, the sort of
agnosticism that lives comfortably somewhere between theism and atheism. His
recommended deep agnosticism is a response to all of life. When we are rushing
ahead to the next moment. When we are sitting in the depths of despair. When we
are desperately controlling the chaos of our lives. “I suggest a deep
agnosticism; truly engaging not-knowing is the universal solvent,” he writes.
“It will release us from our hurt and fears by showing us, not in some abstract
cognitive therapy sort of way, but in the deepest, most visceral way, who we
really are” (p. 84). Declaring “it is what it is” is another way of saying, “I
don’t know.” I don’t know how to fix this. I don’t know what to say or to do. I
don’t know how this will turn out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>When applied superficially, “it is what it is” can be a
welcome buffer to our feelings. When applied correctly, acknowledging what is
calls us more deeply into our suffering and into more compassion for ourselves
and all who suffer. Because all suffer. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The Zen aphorism “pain is inevitable, suffering is
optional” warns us that suffering comes from our attachment to pain. “Pain is
inevitable, suffering is optional” is another one of those phrases that has wandered
into our vocabulary on a superficial level from a way that is beyond words.
This way beyond words, be it Zen or some other spiritual path, requires a
practice. Rev. Ford breaks the Buddhist practice into three categories: 1.
Meditation, 2. Nondual insight and 3. How we live our lives. For the Unitarian
Universalist without a Zen practice, one might consider the categories this
way: 1. Taking time for reflection 2. An experience of the transcendent and 3.
Living from our seven principles. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The three phrases: “it is what it is,” “pain is inevitable,
suffering is optional” and Ford’s “Just don’t know. Only don’t know…” are best
understood within the context of a spiritual practice that creates a lived
experience. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“It is what it is.” Experience directly, in this moment now
what is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.” You are not
your pain. It is not your fault.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'> “Just don’t know. Only don’t know.” Feel this wisdom.
Experience it viscerally. Live these words beyond the surface of their meaning.
Live these words from a way that is beyond words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Ministry continues to call me into a new relationship with
suffering, a way of being that is beyond words, an acceptance of living from a
deep agnosticism. I have learned from serving various congregations, filled
with the wisdom of many thoughtful souls wrestling with the “isness” of their
own suffering. I started in ministry as the intern minister for Horizon Unitarian
Universalist Church, but before I started my internship I visited the
congregation for four weeks as an assignment for my worship arts class. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In the four weeks that I attended Horizon the congregation
experienced a member’s suicide and the murder of a member couple’s adult daughter,
a victim of domestic violence. One Sunday I was there, the service began with
an announcement that there would be a memorial service that afternoon for the
member of the congregation who had recently committed suicide. During the
sharing of “joys and sorrows” Reverend Hamilton acknowledged the congregation’s
loss. Also during the sharing an older man stood and spoke on behalf of his
wife and himself, invoking the memory of their adult child who had died
eighteen months before. He reflected on the difficulty of the passing of that
time and, as he looked around the light-filled worship hall, he said, “The
light still comes through the windows.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Poet and Unitarian Universalist Kathleen Sheeder Bonanno
writes about her daughter’s murder in a collection of poetry entitled <i>Slamming
Open the Door</i>. In “Poem About Light” she writes, </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The unsettling effect of Bonnano’s book is that you sit
with her in her suffering. There is no looking away, no escaping the raw feelings.
“Poem About Light” is the final poem in the book and even as the writer is
finding hope, as light is finding its way in, there is a reminder of how Bonnano’s
daughter died – strangled by a former boyfriend. Ironically, this last poem was
the first poem written about her daughter’s death, read as her victim’s
statement at the trial and at her daughter’s memorial service. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Who among us would say to a parent who has lost a child,
“it is what it is?” Yet we say such awkward mush when people are suffering. We
make the mistake of comparing our suffering to theirs. Either ours is worse or
theirs is. Employing “it is what it is” accurately may mean that we remain
silent when confronted with our neighbor’s suffering. To have compassion, to
suffer with, could be as simple as being with another in the present moment of
what is. To sit quietly, to listen deeply – these are the gifts of being with
what is. Most of us cannot manage our own anxiety when someone we love suffers.
We want to do something to alleviate their suffering, to fix them. We offer a
solution, demonstrating how much we know. Only don’t know, Rev. Ford tells us. 
Sit in an intimacy that knows no boundaries. Sit in the present moment of what
is and your anxious self will drop away into the great current of endless
creation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Afterwards you can take action. Make a casserole. Bake a
cake. Write a card. All of which the good people of the Unitarian Society of
Germantown did for Kathleen Bonanno and her family. In response to her family’s
horrific tragedy, the congregation formed seven committees. There was a funeral
to plan, dogs to be walked and food to be provided. No platitudes about god’s
will were offered, only the open-heartedness of a people used to facing life’s
hard questions with a deep agnosticism. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In the poem “The Unitarian Society of Germantown,” Bonanno
pays tribute to her church describing it as “a big wooden boat” holding her
with her husband as they are tossed about by rain in the dark. The reassuring
words of the minister alone aren’t enough to calm them. She writes that </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I finished my assignment to describe the Horizon UU Church
worship style. I was charged with analyzing the congregation’s piety noting how
it is reflected in their informal, noisy gathering, their deep sharing, their
willingness to laugh at themselves, their surrender to the silence after
prayer, and as they hold hands during the benediction. I was also charged with
discovering where the congregation most clearly shows the “face of its soul.” A
good question to ask of any congregation, I think. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>When I returned to Horizon to serve as their ministerial
intern, I listened to joys and sorrows and answered back with a pastoral
prayer. Some Sundays there was so much to pray for; I wondered how the small
prayer I offered could hold back the darkness. One Sunday there was so much
cancer, another Sunday no one shared a thing – we prayed for all that was
unspoken and that which remained in shadow. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>It is in those moments that I discovered how that beloved
community clearly showed the “face of its soul.” It is the same as The
Unitarian Society of Germantown’s. It is the same here. What does it look like,
this face of a congregation’s soul? I imagine it is a face tilted slightly
upward, bathed in light.</span></p>
