<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>We have been moving towards this moment all
week. Hearing the stories on the news. Stories of survivors and of lives cut
short. Telling our own stories about how the tragedy on that day affected our
own lives. Where we were when we heard the news. How the day seemed to stop as
we stood in shock in front of images of horror. Here is one of the stories from
September 11, 2001. It is the story of two mothers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>Phyllis Rodriguez’s son, Greg, died in the
attacks on the World Trade Center. Aicha el-Wafi’s son, Zacarias Moussaoui, was
convicted of conspiring in the attacks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>Phyllis Rodriguez and Aicha el-Wafi met about
one year after the events of September 2001. Aicha asked that a human rights
organization put her in touch with some of the families of the victims. Phyllis
was the only mother in the group of five families that Aicha met. As mothers,
they felt an instant connection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>Aicha was married when she was 14. She lost
children when she was 15 and 16. The suffering she had already felt as a mother
was increased beyond comprehension when she learned that her son was an Islamic
extremist accused of being a part of the attacks on the World Trade Center. Some
might blame Aicha for raising her son as an Islamic extremist. To blame Aicha
would be to ignore what it is like to be married against your will when you are
still a child, and then be asked to mother sons and daughters in a way that
doesn’t value the spirit of mothering. Today Aicha remains firm in her belief
that her son was not directly responsible for the attacks. She also remains
firm in her belief that extremist thinking like his created a climate that made
the attacks possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>Aicha tells her story of moving to France from
Morocco when she was a young wife and mother at the age of 17. She emphasizes
that she was accepted and welcomed in France. Her son Zacarias was not. While
he was being called “dirty Arab” by peers, at home he was violently treated by
his father who eventually abandoned the family.  Aicha knows that she is not
responsible for the choices her son made as an adult; she feels guilty just for
giving birth to him. Out of a mixture of guilt, anger and compassion Aicha
tells her story to anyone who will listen. She tells her story to young Muslim
girls so that they will fight being married so young and against their will.
She reaches out to other mothers with a message of peace and tolerance. Aicha
stands before us with the face of the “other” and reminds us that our enemy has
a mother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>Greg’s mother Phyllis was listening to a phone message
from Greg saying there had been an accident at the World Trade Center but he
was alright when she saw on television the second plane crash into the second
tower.&nbsp;She didn’t hear from Greg again, and it wasn’t until the next
evening that his death would become official. In the first days after the
attacks and from the depths of their grief, Greg’s parents reached out with a
letter to President Bush asking for peaceful, rational solutions to terrorism. Several
weeks later they spoke out against imposing the death penalty for Zacarias even
before they met his mother.  When they did meet it wasn’t until Phyllis felt
strong enough to face the enormity of her grief. Standing face-to-face with
Aicha, she knew that it was easy for people to sympathize with her own grief
but who would sympathize with Zacarias’ mother? Phyllis realized that, as mothers,
their suffering was the same. <u>She</u> could sympathize with Zacarias’
mother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>As mothers they have been friends for nine
years. As friends and mothers they have worked together for a world in which
forgiveness is a process that places fallible human beings in a context for
which we are all responsible. Phyllis continues to support Aicha in her
campaign to bring Zacarias back to France to serve out his sentence closer to
his mother and to the rest of their family. In telling the story of her first
meeting with Aicha, Phyllis comments how hard it was to meet someone so
different, from such a different culture and who’d led a life that was almost
beyond her comprehension. How afraid we are of the other, Phyllis realized.
After taking the first step and conquering our fears, we can go on to meet all
sorts of “others,” those who are completely different from us. For Phyllis and
her husband this awareness has taken them out of the lives they knew before
their son was killed. They both continue to work with Aicha and now they also
work with convicted murderers, facilitating peace circles and forging new paths
to justice and reconciliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>Just days after the attacks that killed their
son, Phyllis and Orlando Rodriguez wrote a letter to President Bush, which was
published in the <i>New York Times</i>. “This is not the time for empty
gestures to make us feel better,” they wrote. “It is not the time to act like
bullies. We urge you to think about how our government can develop peaceful,
rational solutions to terrorism, solutions that do not sink us to the inhuman
level of terrorists” (<a href="http://inoursonsname.com">http://inoursonsname.com</a>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>Just thirty-four hours after the first plane
struck the World Trade Center, the late Rev. Dr. Forrest Church delivered a
sermon at All Souls Unitarian Church in New York City. He predicted that, in
the years following the tragedy, we would be known for our nation’s resolve in
leading the war on terrorism and as individuals we would be known for how well
we could see ourselves in the faces of the “other.” He warned that we cannot
choose justice over mercy, anger over compassion or war over love. He also
warned that we cannot pray only for peace. When Rev. Church wrote those words
our country had not taken the war on terrorism into Iraq. When he wrote those
words, he admonished us to balance our prayers for peace with action. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>When it looked like our leaders were gathering
evidence to rationalize taking the war on terror into Iraq, I joined with a
small group of peaceful protestors near the JFK memorial in Dallas. About a week
later I joined with another small group on a darkened hillside in a park near
my home, holding candles and silently praying for peace. When the United States
invaded Iraq I read about an effort to call attention to what some termed an
“unjust” war by lighting a candle every night until the war was over. We were
to light this candle in our front window, a visible light against the darkness.
I was the only one in my neighborhood with a candle burning each night. The war
dragged on. The candle didn’t last. When there wasn’t enough wick left to hold
the flame I gave up and threw the candle away. I didn’t replace it with another
candle. I was backing up my prayers for peace with action that mattered little.
It has been ten years since September 11, 2001, some of us are still praying
for peace. What do we do now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>What do we do now that Osama Bin Laden is dead?
What do we do now in response to those in our own country who burn the Koran
and block mosques from being built? What do we do now knowing that we cannot pray
only for peace?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>Unitarian Universalists have historically
supported the “just war” tradition. We have also supported pacifism as is
evidenced by over eighty resolutions written about peace since the merger of
Unitarians and Universalists in 1961. We are not historically a peace church
like Quakers or Mennonites. Our sixth principle is the goal of world community
with peace, liberty, and justice for all. Just as we live with an uncomfortable
ambiguity about the inherent worth and dignity of terrorists and
mass-murderers, we also live with an uncomfortable ambiguity about establishing
peace through violent means. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='color:black'>You can hear it in our 2010 Statement of
Conscience called “Creating Peace” when we state: “</span><span lang=EN
style='color:black'>Many of us believe force is sometimes necessary as a last
resort, while others of us believe in the consistent practice of nonviolence.”
This is our faith at its best: embracing the contradictions and agreeing to
stay in a diverse conversation without any easy answers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span lang=EN style='color:black'>What can we do on this 10<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the loss of our country’s innocence? What can we do on this day
and every day? We can stay in the conversation. Back up our prayers with
action. Even in the face of little progress and passive despair, we can live
knowing that “</span>the common good is best served when each community has a
chance to make its unique contribution” (Eboo Patel, <b>Acts of Faith</b>). Our
unique contribution is a faith built on reason, freedom and tolerance. <span
lang=EN style='color:black'>May we remember that, this day and every day. May
we pray for peace, be peace, and bring peace into all that we do. May it be so.
Amen. </span></p>
