<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>There is a story being told among members of the Unitarian Universalist
Ministers’ Association (UUMA) about a Catholic priest: It seems that in Seattle
the interfaith clergy organization has a tradition of asking senior colleagues
to share their life odysseys. On this particular occasion, a Roman Catholic
Priest was telling his story, and he said that his life had been in large
measure a failure. He remembered the heady days of Vatican II and how hopeful
he and his generation of liberal priests had been that real change was coming
to the church he loved so dearly. And yet; these many years later he felt that
the church had if anything become hardened and deeply conservative, and his
dreams had not been realized. Now, this priest was someone who was valued among
his interfaith colleagues, and they were somewhat hurt and stunned by his
revelation. And yet; one colleague noted, despite the severity of his words,
his demeanor seemed quite peaceful and content. ‘How can you claim that your
life was a failure, and yet appear so calm and serene?’ ‘I know whose I am,’
replied the priest. ‘I know whose I am.’” (<i>Whose Are We Facilitator Program</i>
Page 4, UUA).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>This story is told to members of the UUMA attending a retreat or
workshop, there is a very long pause and then we are asked “Whose are we?”
“Whose are you?” “Whose am I?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>I was first asked this question last year attending the Mountain Desert
District Retreat. I had just left my family and community behind in Dallas to
set off on my first year in ministry alone. I had been gone for three weeks. It
was two days after I had celebrated my birthday with total strangers. It was a
good question to ask a new minister who had just been launched into mystery.
“Whose am I?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>The Reverend Gordon McKeeman is minister emeritus of the Unitarian
Universalist Church of Akron, Ohio, where he served for twenty-two years, and a
former president of Starr King School for the Ministry until his retirement in
1988. He served for many years on the UUA board of trustees and several
committees, and has written widely on ministry, theology, spiritual discipline
and education. McKeeman wrote that “<span style='font-family:"TimesNewRomanPSMT","serif"'>Ministry
is a quality of relationship between and among human beings that beckons forth
hidden possibilities. It is inviting people into deeper, more constant, more
reverent relationship with the world and with one another.” </span>Gordon
McKeeman mentored many students during his time as the president of Starr King
School for the Ministry. The Reverend Dennis Hamilton was one of those
students. Dennis Hamilton mentored me during my ministerial internship. Whose
am I? I am Gordon McKeeman’s. I am Dennis Hamilton’s. I belong to the ministers
of First Unitarian Church of Dallas, the Rev. Dr. Laurel Hallman and the Rev.
Dr. Daniel Kanter, ministers who inspire me to excellence. I belong to a long
tradition that “invites people into deeper, more constant, more reverent relationship
with the world and with one another.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Whose am I? I am also yours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>The story of the “perfect minister” is another story that circulates
among my colleagues. Both Unitarian Universalists and non-UUs like to include
this laugh out loud list of attributes in newsletter articles and sermons as a
light-hearted reminder to congregations searching for new ministers and in
other times of transition. It is a humorous reminder that the minister you call
is human. I happen to like this description of the perfect minister: “He works
from 8:00 AM until midnight and is also a janitor. He makes $50 a week, wears
good clothes, buys good books, drives a good car, and gives about $50 weekly to
the poor. He is 28 years old and has preached 30 years….” I like this description
of the perfect minister because the perfect minister is obviously a man. That
lets me off the hook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>It lets me “off the hook” of that list but there is another list that
binds me, that tells me whose I am. This list was created by your ministerial
search committee last year and I think it’s worth reading to you as we start
our new ministry together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>The Conejo Unitarian Universalist Fellowship is looking for</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>A talented and inspired
     preacher who will consistently deliver provocative and moving worship
     programs and sermons.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>A visionary leader who will
     articulate a compelling, motivating mission to attract new people, inspire
     deeper commitment in our existing members, and illuminate our
     congregation’s voice and identity.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>An empathetic shepherd with strong
     people skills, who is warm, who connects with others and truly enjoys
     people individually, and who will foster in us all a sense of community
     and healthy relationships.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>A strategic thinker who will
     support and guide our lay leaders, members, and staff, steering us always
     toward improving our management, communication, and stewardship skills and
     practices in ways that are collaborative and empowering.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>A minister who is dedicated to
     our growth, in every sense of that word.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>A minister who will bring to our
     service a profound and sacred respect for the diverse spiritual paths,
     beliefs, and interests among our members.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>A minister who will
     appreciate, share and nurture our congregation’s love of music, drama, art
     and creativity.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>A minister who will embrace the
     children in our congregation, and who will be a champion for them, their
     religious education, and their families.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>A minister who is passionate
     about social justice and about engaging with others to provide visible
     public witness in the larger community.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>An individual of strong
     personal character and integrity whose behavior models Unitarian
     Universalist values and principles.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Whose am I? I am the servant of this clearly articulated vision. I am the
servant of an idea that leads us all into what this Fellowship is becoming.
Whose am I? I am yours. And if this list calls us all into rigid perfection,
then I am also the student of a man who likes to say he gets paid for being
human. This is the minister’s role put succinctly by my mentor, the Rev. Dennis
Hamilton: A minister is someone who gets paid for being human. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>And as a flawed, vulnerable human I am grateful to stand every Sunday in
the place I had been hoping to stand for so long. Literally I am standing,
leading worship. Figuratively I am standing in such a way so that Love can move
through me. What I feel in many moments of ministry is the love for another
human being that is not the personal attachment love of friendship but the
greater Love that isn’t mine to give in the first place, but somehow needs me
(and you) to be manifest. This is the me/not me of ministry that reminds me of
my humanity and my humility. Ministry is done through me not by me, and it
absolutely knocks me down to my knees in awe every time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>Whose am I? I belong to the Spirit of Love and Life, this God of many
names and mystery beyond all our naming, this word we cannot agree on this
thing that is beyond us, within us and among us, this elephant in the room that
we cannot name because we dare not exclude anyone who enters our doors. Whose
am I? I belong to Unitarian Universalism and I serve something larger than our
faith. Whose am I? I belong to those who have come before me who have served in
the role of priest and prophet, I belong to this whole human dilemma and I
belong to God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'>There, I said it. And now the conversation begins. A good place to start
a conversation about God is with a quote from a Buddhist. American Buddhist
nun, author and teacher Pema Chodron writes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>The difference between theism and
nontheism is not whether one does or does not believe in God. It is an issue
that applies to everyone, including both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Theism is
a deep-seated conviction that there’s some hand to hold: if we just do the
right things, someone will appreciate us and take care of us. …Nontheism is
relaxing with the ambiguity and uncertainty of the present moment without
reaching for anything to protect ourselves. (<i>When Things Fall Apart</i> p.
40)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>If I just fix this
one problem at work everything will be okay. If I just make more money
everything will be okay. If I do what the congregation tells me to do then
everything will be okay. Preaching, leading, empathizing, strategizing, growing
the congregation,  sacred respect, love of the arts, encouraging children,
engaging in social justice, character and integrity – the ten characteristics
you wanted your new minister to have - are not gifts from a God who reaches
down from the sky and makes everything okay. The God I serve is the God of the
still, small voice inside both you and me. The divine I serve unfolds in my
unfolding, emerges from my emerging self, and is revealed in sacred
relationship. Whose am I? I belong to those who come before me, I am yours and
I belong to the ongoing act of creation itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A story is told. A
Catholic priest proclaims, “I know whose I am” and Unitarian Universalist
ministers ask each other the question, “Whose Are We?” “Whose Are We” is a
curriculum developed for UU ministers, funded by the Fund for Unitarian
Universalism and The UUA Panel on Theological Education. It is the type of
program funded by our annual Association Sunday that this year is a celebration
of all our ministries: parish ministry, community ministry, music ministry and
religious education. “Whose Are We” is a probing curriculum that asks ministers
who may be more comfortable with the language of psychology, philosophy and
sociology to ground their ministry in the language of theology. As a part of
this program, UUMA chapters are providing small groups for spiritual
discernment, practice and support. One of the goals is that UU congregations
will benefit from a clearer theological and spiritual grounding for the work of
building the beloved community and creating justice in the larger world. What
is our “saving message” and how do we tell our communities who we are and what
larger purpose we serve? Who are we? What are we?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Douglas Steere, a
Quaker teacher, says that the ancient question, “What am I?” inevitably leads
to a deeper one, “Whose am I?” – because there is no identity outside of
relationships. (from the UUMA curriculum, “Whose Are We?”) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>All of us who
serve in our many professional ministries are asked to answer the question, “Whose
are we?” And so are you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>What calls you
here today? What calls you to a religious community? What calls you out of
yourself and into relationship with the transcendent? Whose are you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I invite you into
a conversation that begins today. I invite you into a conversation that does
not end with my time here or your time here because who we serve is the past,
present and the future. I invite you into the language of metaphor, the
language of the Spirit. God is not God’s name. God is a metaphor. The holy, the
divine, the transcendent, all of these are metaphors for the deeper human
experience that calls us out of our small selves into our better selves. Whose
are you?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>When I first met
you in April I shared my spiritual practice of exploring deeper meaning through
the language of metaphor as used in poetry and other inspired writing. I shared
Gordon McKeeman’s meditation on the meaning of ministry with some of you and
then talked about how everything we do here is ministry. How, as Unitarian
Universalists, ours is a shared ministry. The group I shared this with
expressed relief at this concept of shared ministry, wondering how one person
could do all that is described by McKeeman. Yet there is this daunting list of
10 characteristics that I am expected to embody as the professional minister
called to serve this congregation. I do not live into this list alone. “Whose
are we” is not a question asked only to celebrate excellence in our
professional ministry. It is a question we can ask each other. When we know
whose we are we can relax into the uncertainty of the present moment. When we
know whose we are. We can celebrate who we are.</p>
