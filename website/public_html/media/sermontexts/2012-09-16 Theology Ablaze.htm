<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We begin with a lump in our throats and a fire in
our souls. We begin, not by closing our hearts and minds, but by opening all of
the senses of our beings. We begin walking together, reflecting on words tossed
into the fire of truth. We begin digging deeper this time, knowing there’s a
fire just waiting for fuel.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We begin this church year together, united by a
common theological exploration. Today while we are sifting through the ashes of
words like theology and religion, our youngest children are singing along to
“This Little Light of Mine” and reading along with the children’s book
“Unitarian Universalism is a Really Long Name.” Our older children are
reflecting on what it means to develop a theology as young religious Unitarian
Universalists. All of our children are walking to their classes this morning
down a hallway decorated with chalices ablaze with multi-colored flames. It
takes more than a single flame to start our year together. It takes all of us,
from the musicians to the volunteer teachers, from the ushers to the kitchen
helpers, from our youngest babies playing in child space to our wisest elders
listening through the headsets to our amplified worship experience. Ours is a
religion that asks us to take personal responsibility for forming our own
theology. Yet, we cannot do it alone. Our own light grows stronger in the
company of others. We burn brighter in community. Our theology becomes more
articulate when we gather together, giving us the practical tools to find the
courage to cause our lives to flame.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Many of us, like the Rev. Dr. William Schulz, “call
[our] feelings about theology ‘ambivalent,’ and [hopefully] not irredeemably
hostile” (forward to <i>Theology Ablaze</i>). We begin with a lump in our
throats and a fire in our souls. We begin with the word theology. Schulz
reminds us that “theological questions … begin as, Robert Frost said poems do,
with a lump in the throat, not an algebraic logarithm.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Rev. Tom Owen-Towle, the minister emeritus of
the First Unitarian Universalist Church of San Diego, wrote the book <i>Theology
Ablaze </i>last year in celebration of the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary year of
Unitarian Universalism. He also wrote it for a maturing faith, one that at age
50 could handle the challenge of naming a Unitarian Universalist theology, a
religion that has moved beyond the necessity of consolidation into one that can
embrace a depth theology. In his book he provides 26 theological themes defined
through a Unitarian Universalist lens. Is there a unified Unitarian
Universalist theology one might ask, or would it be better to say theologies?
This is one of many questions we’ll ask together this year in worship, in
religious education and even with a workshop taught by Rev. Owen-Towle in
April. We will throw words into the fire, burning away the dross of accumulated
misinterpretation and we will experience them anew.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>First up is theology, first defined for us in 1963,
two years after the merger, in a document titled <i>The Free Church in a
Changing World</i>. The authors, a study commission “comprised of religious
professionals, academics, writers and artists, nonprofit administrators, and
others…define[s] ‘theology as a critical and creative intellectual attempt to
express, clarify, defend, reconstruct religion’…adding that ‘religion is
related to theology as practice is to theory…and we should never mistake
theology for religion, or assume that the concept of theology can adequately
substitute for the breadth and depth of religion.’” (<i>Theology Ablaze</i>,
p.6) Theology is formed in a dark night of the soul; religion is what has been
pieced together over time by scholars, professional religious and lay people
alike each adding to the rich tapestry of the human response to the duality of
being born and having to die.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In 2005 the definition of theology was updated by a
new commission, this time working for four years to create a report called <i>Engaging
our Theological Diversity. </i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><i>While
the root words of the term theology refer to “reason or discourse about God,”
these questions assume a much broader understanding of its meaning. In modern
usage, the definition of theology is understood to include the full range of
religious and philosophical beliefs (not just theistic ones) and our human
understanding of the meaning and purpose of life and of Ultimate Reality.</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><i>&nbsp;</i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>In this most recent
definition one can almost hear our maturity as a faith blazing forth. We
acknowledge the root of the term in God language and celebrate the postmodern
tendency to re-imagine and re-invent language. A mature faith is like a mature
human being: no longer needing to define one’s identity by what one has
rejected from a parent, the mature adult embraces what is best from its parents
and bases its identity on lived experience rather than inherited traits. As a
mature religious movement, Unitarian Universalism can use the word theology
acknowledging its roots in God language while embracing the freedom that
liberal religion offers to reinterpret past truths once rigidly defined.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This maturity was acknowledged by the past president
of the UUA in his well-known “language of reverence” sermon when he said,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><i>I
believe that Unitarian Universalism is growing up. Growing out of a cranky and
contentious adolescence into a more confident maturity. A maturity in which we
can not only claim our Good News, the values we have found in this free faith,
but also begin to offer that Good News to the world outside these beautiful
sanctuary walls. There is a new willingness on our part to come in from the
margins.</i> (Quoted in Embracing our Theological Diversity, p. 4)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>As we come in from the
margins and embrace our theological diversity we are learning a common
language. This is what the book <i>Theology Ablaze</i> offers us and this is
why we have chosen it for our theme this year. In a world where people are
dying because of words and images used to attack religious beliefs, we can
summon the courage to throw old, dangerous words into the fire and see what new
meanings emerge.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Words like gratitude, beauty, interdependence, peace
and nonviolence are easy enough. There are harder, more dangerous words. We
have all heard the joke about why UUs do not sing out in church – they are busy
reading ahead in the hymnal to see if they agree with the text. Words like
covenant, sacred, evil and God are dangerous words for many Unitarian
Universalists. And they can be dangerous words for fundamentalists on either
end of the scale.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This is the premise of another book we’ll study
together this year by Gary Eberle. <i>Dangerous Words: Talking about God in an
Age of Fundamentalism </i>invites us to “move beyond religions (plural) and
understand how the religious impulse, shared by all our species, finds its rich
expression in the many vocabularies we use to name our gods. The greatness of
God transcends all names. Most traditions affirm this, so now we must decide
either to find a common language and speak with each other or to continue our
war of words and live in a post-Babel world of confusion” (p. xvii). If you
just heard a very theistic interpretation of the word god in Gary Eberle’s
words then you are probably not alone. Together we’ll throw that word into the
fire twice, once with a sermon from me and then again with Tom Owen-Towle who
will not only offer a workshop April 13<sup>th</sup> but will preach April 14<sup>th</sup>.
Justine and I have purposefully designed our thematic ministry to wrestle
longer with words that are our most worthy opponents. We will sit by the fire
with words like God, covenant, Sabbath, death, sacred, love, grace and even
gratitude more than once. Words like God are theologically divisive. Words like
gratitude seem easier and that’s why they are so often taken for granted.
Living with gratitude challenges us to let go of perfection and in Rumi’s words
to “be grateful for whoever comes.”  “A joy, a depression, a meanness, some
momentary awareness comes [A]s an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain
them all!” A theology ablaze is a deep theology. A deep theology knows to be
grateful for whoever or whatever comes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A deep theology takes us back to that corner in
Manhattan described by singer / songwriter Ani DiFranco in the song “fuel.”
Digging deeper “beneath the bedrock of the mystery” and “beneath everything i
can think of to think about… there's a fire that's just waiting for fuel.” The
fire is the divine spark in each of us. The fuel is our vocabulary of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Faith is on the list and so are embodiment,
suffering, silence, prayer, justice, salvation, joy, mystery and wonder,
self-care, forgiveness and reconciliation, hospitality, hope and evolution. All
of these words constitute the Unitarian Universalist vocabulary of faith, words
that define our theology. All of these words lift us out of the impulse to numb
ourselves to a cross-marketed, information-saturated world. All of these words
take us deeper into the religious impulse, shared by our entire species. It is
important to remember that this is not just a conversation, this is a spiritual
discipline. In the forward to Jeanne Harrison Nieuwejaar’s <i>Fluent in Faith</i>
William Sinkford writes that his call to a “language of reverence” “was a
beginning, not an end point. We are people of the word, it is true,” he writes.
“But religious life is practiced, not just spoken.” We are all invited into a
“’Practice of Reverence,’ not merely a conversation about religious language”
(Fluent in Faith, location 107).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What does this practice look like? It looks like
what we often name as the marks of our religious community: participating in
worship, attending congregational meetings and exercising our right to vote,
cultivating generosity, contributing time and talent, and becoming intentional
about our own spiritual growth. This practice, this spiritual practice, also
looks like taking a religious education class, attending community forum and
participating in a social justice outreach event. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is interesting to note that the word spiritual is
not on Tom Owen-Towle’s list. It does show up in one of my planned sermon
titles and is implied by most of the words. You can hear it kindling the
theology of gratitude, Sabbath, grace, embodiment, sacred, silence, love and
prayer. It is our third principle: Acceptance of one another and encouragement
to spiritual growth in our congregations. Tom Owen-Towle doesn’t put the word
spiritual on the list of our core theological themes because it is not a theme;
it is how we are called to be when we engage our theological diversity. In
fact, the word spiritual shows up on almost every page of the 2005 document <i>Engaging
Our Theological Diversity. </i>Spirituality always points us to something
larger than ourselves. If theology is to religion as theory is to practice,
then spirituality is what moves us beyond theology as conversation into
theology as transformation. Spirituality takes us deeper “beneath the bedrock
of mystery.” Spirituality takes us through the fires of our lives, causing us
to burn like the burning bush from the Hebrew Scriptures. Burning with a
theology ablaze, we are more fully alive and, like the burning bush, we are not
consumed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We begin with a lump in our throats and a fire in
our souls. We begin, not by closing our hearts and minds, but by opening all of
the senses of our beings. We begin walking together, reflecting on words tossed
into the fire of truth. We begin digging deeper this time, knowing there’s a
fire just waiting for fuel. The fire is the divine spark in each of us. The
fuel is our vocabulary of faith.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Eckhart Tolle, the author of <i>The Power of Now</i>,
employs a striking image for those of us seeking to find the courage to cause
our lives to flame with a theology ablaze with meaning and depth. “When a log
that has only just started to burn is placed next to one that is burning
fiercely,” he writes “and after a while they are separated again, the first log
will be burning with much greater intensity. After all it is the same fire. To
be such a fire is one of the functions of a spiritual teacher,” he concludes.
(p. 34). To be such a fire is one of the functions of our gathered community.
We are each sitting next to a divine fire burning with great intensity. Together
we burn brighter. Together we are ablaze.</p>
