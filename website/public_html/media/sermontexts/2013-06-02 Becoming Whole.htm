style='color:black'>Evangelist Rob Bell likes to tell the story about an art
show that his mega-church held and the paintings and sculptures that people
brought in to put on display. There was one piece that drew a lot of attention.
It had a beautiful quote from Gandhi included in its composition. Many found
the piece compelling, but one observer was prompted to attach a handwritten
note that read, “Reality check – he’s in hell.” “Gandhi’s in hell? Really?”
asks Bell. “He is, and someone knows this for sure?” This question sent Bell on
a journey that got him in trouble with conservative evangelicals, put him on
the cover of <i>Time Magazine</i> as one of the world’s most 100 influential
people, and ultimately led to his departure from the 11,000 member congregation
he founded. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In his book <i>Love Wins: A Book About Heaven, Hell And The
Fate Of Every Person Who Ever Lived, </i>Pastor Bell had the audacity to
proclaim: “At the center of the Christian tradition since the first church have
been a number who insist that history is not tragic, hell is not forever, and
love, in the end, wins and all will be reconciled to God.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Carlton Pearson was once the pastor of one of the largest
churches in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In the 1990s the average attendance was more than
6,000 each Sunday. You can hear Pearson’s brand of Universalist theology in the
titles of two of his books: <i>The Gospel of Inclusion: Reaching Beyond
Religious Fundamentalism to the True Love of God</i> and <i>God Is Not a
Christian, Nor a Jew, Muslim, Hindu…</i>. Pearson was declared a heretic by his
peers in the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops and his
church closed. The few followers that were left eventually followed Pearson to
All Souls Unitarian Church in Tulsa. After he left Tulsa to pastor a New
Thought congregation in Chicago, those who had heard the gospel of universal
reconciliation stayed on as members of All Souls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Most recently Pope Francis said, &quot;The Lord has redeemed
all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics.
Everyone! ‘Father, the atheists?’ Even the atheists. Everyone!&quot; We must
meet one another doing good. ‘But I don’t believe, Father, I am an atheist!’
But do good: we will meet one another there.” Several days later a Vatican
spokesman clarified the Catholic Church’s position by reassuring everyone that
atheists are still going to hell. Belief in God is still needed to get into
heaven, but there is hope. According to the Vatican spokesman, “every man or
woman, whatever their situation, can be saved. Even non-Christians can respond
to this saving action of the Spirit. No person is excluded from salvation
simply because of so-called original sin.” (both quotes from <a
href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com">www.huffingtonpost.com</a>) So-called
original sin….</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Most conversations about salvation begin with sin. Unitarian
Universalists have a bad reputation when it comes to sin. We see the world
through rose-colored glasses, we are too “Pollyannaish,” TOO hopeful. Long ago
our religious ancestors rejected the doctrine of original sin, embraced various
forms of Christian universalism and when the principles and purposes of our
consolidated movement were crafted we affirmed the inherent worth and dignity
of every person. This is one of our most difficult principles from which to
live. When we take our rose-colored glasses off and look around at the
suffering in our world caused by those supposedly worthy and dignified human
beings, we too wonder if there should be a hell reserved for our world’s worst
offenders. Love wins is a hard message to sell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Universalism came to this continent from England just as
our country’s revolution was brewing. It comes into our heritage through a
broken line of early Christian Church Fathers such as Clement of Alexandria and
Origen. It is a broken line because many of these teachings were considered
heretical; many of these teachings were lost in the fires of inquisition and
intolerance. It is also a broken line because it comes out of a story that
starts with an apple, a fall from grace and a picture of totally deprived
humanity that can only be reconciled to God by an act of God. The doctrine of
Universal Salvation gets complicated. This is why the simple message “Love
Wins” makes so many people uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The simple message “Love Wins” also makes a lot of people
comfortable – comforting them in their struggle for self-worth while they
listen to a story about how sinners and unbelievers are punished for all
eternity. The story used to be worse; it actually included an alternate ending
that not only said that some would get to heaven but this alternate theology
also said it didn’t matter what you believed or even how you behaved. Some were
predestined; some were elected by God. Some were in and some were out and only
God knew who.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>By the late 1700s there were at least seventeen
Universalist ministers preaching the good news in America that all would be
saved, not could be, but would be. This variation of Universal Salvation, one
that Rob Bell seems to promote in his book <i>Love Wins,</i> doesn’t mean that
all are going to heaven immediately upon death. There is a strain in Christian
Universalism that accounts for some divine punishment, and that God’s
reconciling love means that punishment doesn’t last forever. The Universalism we
inherit from our religious forbears comes through the broken line of early
Christian fathers by way of an American Universalism that was a grass roots
movement of people reading the Bible for themselves and seeing in it a
redemptive love made possible by the life and death of Jesus. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Unitarian Universalism now finds itself as a maturing faith
at a time when, according to the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, 74% of
Americans still believe in heaven but only 59% believe in hell. Do we just roll
our eyes when the Vatican corrects the Pope’s “salvation by good works”
theology? Do we applaud Rob Bell when he proclaims “Love Wins,” saying welcome
to the club we’ve been waiting for you for two hundred years?! Can we do more
than just invite survivors of hell-steeped evangelism into our Sunday morning
worship? Well, of course we can. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We can when we open our doors wider than our fear of
intimacy and wider than our own stubborn need to be right. When we declare that
our spiritual but not dogmatic way of doing religion is the only way then we
are just as guilty as those who say the only way to heaven is through the one,
true church. When we honor our own theological heritage as Christian Universalists
we can celebrate any movement in institutionalized religion towards more
inclusiveness. We can be cautiously optimistic. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We also need to recognize that even as the Catholic Church
shakes off some of the shackles of medieval theology and tries to respond to
the modern world with a more inclusive message, Church leaders still stumble
along the path of exclusivity. They still define their religion by drawing a
circle around themselves, defining “non-believers” as outsiders. The Pope’s
radical-sounding statement that “we must meet one another doing good,” even the
atheists, isn’t that radical when you understand that he is still clinging to a
story that requires the redeeming blood of a crucified savior for access to salvation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>There is a different story told about sin and salvation,
one told by Christians since the beginning. Human beings do sin, not because of
so-called original sin, which is rooted in rebellion against God. Human beings
sin because we are human. It is a story told by many world religions: life is
suffering.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This is Buddhism’s First Noble Truth - duhkha. The Sanskrit
word duhkha is usually translated as suffering and can also be interpreted as stress,
anxiety or dissatisfaction. It is much more than any of these, however. If we
trace the etymology of the word, it leads us to a metaphor of the hub of a
wheel not properly centered, so the wheel cannot properly function. Duhkha,
then, is the recognition that the way we live is off-centered. We are not at
ease in our humanness; we are dis-eased. This is similar to a broad Christian
understanding of sin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We are not at ease; we are not functioning the way we
should. We accumulate this dis-ease during a lifetime of responding to pain
inflicted by our parents, acts of physical and emotional violence and broken
relationships of all sorts. We keep ourselves from our own healing by our very
woundedness. We keep ourselves from hearing healing in other people’s stories
because we cling to the way things are. People suffer because they are limited
by their images of the world, by the stories they tell themselves. This is how
we sin. We sin when we think happiness comes when we get what we want, when
circumstances change from what they are now, when those we blame get “it”, when
we get the right job, spouse, car…“fill in the blank.” We sin and we are in
need of salvation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>A Unitarian Universalist doctrine of sin includes the
personal brokenness of the human condition. It is also includes collective
damage: war, poverty, environmental devastation, racial and gender oppression –
it’s a long list. Unitarian Universalists name the process of becoming whole as
salvation. Salvation, for most of us, is healing from the brokenness of the
human condition. Salvation is how poet and UU minister Lynn Ungar describes it
in her poem by the same name: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Do you believe me when I say</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Salvation is our mission statement: to nurture spiritually
courageous people who transform the world through justice and compassion. Eckhart
Tolle states that “true salvation is a state of freedom – from fear, from suffering,
from a perceived state of lack and insufficiency and therefore from all
wanting, needing, grasping, and clinging. It is freedom from compulsive
thinking, from negativity, and above all from past and future as a
psychological need” (<i>The Power of Now</i>, p. 122) “There is no <i>only</i>
way to salvation, but there is only one point of access” (Tolle). That point of
access is now. Salvation doesn’t come at the end of a life well-lived with acts
of good works and / or by believing a certain way. Salvation comes in this life
now. We make heaven here on earth and hell, if we choose that instead. And
evangelist Rob Bell agrees. In fact, it’s in the Bible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>According to Bell (and a lot of other scholars), Jesus
wasn’t telling people how to get to heaven. He was teaching people how to live
now. In Matthew 19:16-22 the story is told of a rich young man who asks Jesus
how to have eternal life. Jesus doesn’t answer with, “here is how you get to
heaven.” He says, “If you wish to enter into life…” The story ends with the
young, rich man leaving in disappointment. He refuses to sell all he has to
enter into the “kingdom of heaven” or what Jesus has previously named as
entering into life. “Heaven for Jesus wasn’t just ‘someday’,” Bell writes; “it
was a present reality. Jesus blurs the lines, inviting the rich man, and us,
into the merging of heaven and earth, the future and present, <i>here</i> and <i>now</i>.”
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The rich young man isn’t able to enter fully into life
because his possessions get in the way. For us it may be our clinging to the
way things are, our refusal to write a new story, our compulsive thinking or our
constant negativity that keep us from entering fully into life, that keep us from
salvation, from becoming whole. Our definition of universal salvation has
changed from a nineteenth century, mostly Christian, one. When we declare
ourselves to be Unitarian Universalists we proclaim that all human beings are
capable of redemption in this life now, of being saved right now, all are
capable of becoming whole now. Every person. Even you. Yes you.</span></p>
