that I often use as a bookmark. I do not remember when I got it, but the
copyright indicates it was printed in 1983. This is odd because the date does
not correspond to either of the two times I was “introduced” to Siddha Yoga.
The mantra of the Siddha lineage is printed on the top of the first page of the
card: “Om Namah Shivaya.” The translation appears below it: “I honor the Self
within me.” According to the information printed on the card:</span></p>

margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>This mantra has been handed down
through the Siddha lineage for centuries. It is a powerful tool for quieting
the mind during the process of meditation. When the mind is filled with the
vibrations of the mantra, it is naturally drawn away from its involvement in
the outer world, and effortlessly turns back towards its source, the inner
Self.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>            This
mantra has been used by the masters of the Siddha tradition and infused with
their spiritual power. Because of this it is considered to be <i>chaitanya</i>
or alive, and has the power to awaken the inner meditative energy called <i>kundalini</i>.
Once this potential is awakened, meditation happens spontaneously and spiritual
evolution accelerates naturally. Through the continued use of the mantra and
the unfolding of the <i>kundalini</i> energy, you attain the highest state,
realization of your own inner divinity – the Self.</span></p>

the card is this summary of Siddha Yoga’s teaching: “Meditate on your own Self.
Worship your Self. Respect your Self. God dwells within you as you.” In his address
to the senior class at Harvard Divinity School Emerson, the “Seer of Concord”, sounds
a lot like an Indian Swami from the twentieth century. </span></p>

first time I was introduced to Siddha Yoga was more than 30 years ago as a
sophomore in college when a professor of mine sponsored an evening of
meditation on campus. The experience was profound and I hoped to recreate it by
visiting the meditation center the next week. I brought along two friends who
had been impressed by my story of “being breathed, rather than breathing.” On
the way to the center we got lost, finally giving up and turning back. </span></p>

years later I was going through a divorce, confronting childhood issues, and
mourning the loss of my best friend to AIDS. One day a co-worker sat next to me
and asked if I had ever meditated. I have meditated off and on since I was
about fifteen. A friend of mine had given me a copy of <i>Autobiography of a
Yogi</i> by Paramhansa Yogananda. Coincidentally that was the year I had
stopped attending church with my family. I bought a book on Hatha Yoga and
taught myself various postures and how to meditate. So when my co-worker asked
me that day, “have you ever meditated?” I laughed at the gentle reminder from
universal mind, the “Unseen Spirit of the Universe,” the higher Self, the “call
it what you will” of Life. I laughed even more when I found out that my
co-worker had been meditating at the Siddha Yoga Center of Dallas – that place
I went looking for so many years before, and somehow had not been able to find.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:37.45pt;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Emerson
wrote in his journal: “There is a Mind to whom all [other] greatness is vanity
&amp; nothing; who did himself create and communicate all the intellect that
exists; &amp; there is a mode of intercourse provided by which we can approach
this excellent majesty. That Mind is God; and that Mode is Prayer.” The mode of
prayer I discovered took me away from the Christian faith of my childhood,
sustained me through my darker moments, and continues to push me beyond self to
Self in my constant seeking. Many UUs leave behind the Christian faith of their
childhoods pushed away by ideas about God that stifle their spirits and
constrict their very beings. I have often heard it said that Unitarian
Universalism saves lives. I would say that my life was saved before I became a
UU, but after my life was saved by the mode of prayer and the God I discovered
in meditation, I could not return to the Christian faith of my childhood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:37.45pt;line-height:200%;text-autospace:
none'><span style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Until
recently I have had a difficult time reconciling my spiritual practice with
what I perceived as the rationalism of our tradition. Led by Emerson, the
Transcendentalists confronted the rationalism of nineteenth century Unitarianism
with an appeal to intuition and emotion. Specifically, Emerson looked to the
“God Within” as a basis for his faith. Emerson also turned his back on the
institution of the church at the same time he rejected the “corpse-cold”
Unitarianism of his day. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Emerson
criticized a religion constrained by tradition and history. Now that Emerson is
part of our tradition and history, how can we hear his words in such a way that
they enliven our faith? In other words, what of Emerson’s thought is <i>chaitanya</i>
or alive for us, serving as a sort of mantra to awaken the God Within,
awakening our reason as well as our experience?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%'>Here are questions from Emerson’s introduction to his
essay <i>Nature</i>: “Why should not we also enjoy an original relation to the
universe? Why should not we have a poetry and philosophy of insight and not of
tradition, and a religion by revelation to us, and not the history of theirs?”<sup>
</sup>These are questions that many of us ask prior to finding ourselves in a
UU church for the first time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the book <i>In Good and Generous Faith: Christian
Responses to Religious Pluralism, </i>Christian theologian Kenneth Cracknell
writes of a phenomenon called “passing over” in which someone of one faith
tradition, for a time, experiences another faith tradition. Much is gained from
this “passing over” but eventually, according to Cracknell, we must come back
to “our mother tongue.” Cracknell tells us:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-right:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:
normal'>Our mother tongue is the medium we use for our deepest expressions, our
ultimate perceptions: in moments of ecstasy or crisis, we cry out in our own
tongue. However much we pass over into the other linguistic frames of
reference, ultimately we come back to that which grasped us and moulded us from
the beginning of our lives. In the same way, however much Christians enter into
the worship, culture, literature and community life of people of a different
faith they remain rooted in their own tradition.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><sup>&nbsp;</sup></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>As Unitarian Universalists,
Christianity, or for some Judaism, may be our first language. We are not only
exploring other linguistic frames of reference from other faith traditions. We
are also creating a new language. As Emerson might put it, we are learning the
language of the Soul.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When we listen to the wisdom of Emerson’s soul we
hear that, in his words, “There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly
listening we shall hear the right word.”<sup> </sup>The temptation, then, in
discovering what is alive in Emerson’s thought, is to rely on Emerson’s thought
alone and to elevate it to the same place that tradition has always occupied:
some dusty shelf that we rarely visit. Our tradition is a living tradition.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Our Puritan ancestors devoted much of their time and
energy to the development of their interior lives. They adhered to a practice
of daily and evening prayer that was similar to the traditional Catholic daily
office. This practice reflected the sense of the cycle of death and rebirth
found in the Christian pattern of worship. Private piety complemented public
piety; Sunday worship was supposed to work together with private worship
practices in order to strengthen their lives as Christians. In breaking with
some of our Christian piety as a faith tradition we have lost this connection
between a disciplined private spiritual practice and our public worship
practice. Many of us regain this connection through spiritual practices offered
by other traditions. My private spiritual discipline is Yoga, but there are
many other traditions that can serve us, such as Buddhism, Jewish mystical
traditions and Neo-Paganism. We can also look to the Transcendentalists in our
own tradition for inspiration.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A common criticism of a theology that celebrates the
God Within can be found in this quote by G.K. Chesterton: “the most horrible is
the worship of the god within…. That Jones shall worship the god within him
turns out ultimately to mean that Jones shall worship Jones.’<sup> </sup>This
criticism lacks “holy imagination” - the sort of imagination that is needed to
understand that Jones’ self is intrinsically bound up in Self. The only way to
have knowledge of Self is to have knowledge of self.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Worshipping the God Within is not a selfish act, but
certainly can lead one away from church. Emerson left preaching for various
reasons, not solely, as is usually reported, because he disagreed with his
parishioners over the meaning of the Lord’s Supper. He left the church because
it was not his true vocation. He himself warned against an inner focus that
lacks connection to what he identified as “rough experience.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is a definite difference, in Emerson’s
thought, between this rough experience, the stuff that life throws at us from
time to time, suffering…and what might be called mystical experience. Emerson
warns us, again in his words, that ‘metaphysics must be perpetually reinforced
by life.’ Balance must be sought; we must not forget Emerson’s call to find a
deeper meaning in “rough experience” along with the meaning that comes from the
more mystical experiences that are revealed to us by listening to the inner
self. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Writer Erik
Reece makes connections between <i>The Jefferson Bible</i>, Emerson’s “Divinity
School Address” and the Gospel of Thomas to help construct what he identifies
as a uniquely American gospel. One of Jesus’ sayings from The Gospel of Thomas
can remind us of Emerson’s God: “But the Kingdom is within you and it is
without you. If you know yourselves, then you will know that you are the sons
of the Living Father.”<sup> </sup></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In the words of
the Indian Swami, “Meditate on your own Self. Worship your Self. Respect your
Self. God dwells within you as you.” Reece tells the story of his Baptist
minister father, himself the son of a Baptist minister who preached the sort of
Calvinistic original sin and eternal damnation that Unitarian and Universalist Christians
rejected in the nineteenth century. Reece’s father committed suicide when Reece
was a young boy and to escape the depression he inherited from his father,
Reece left his family’s faith. He found hope in the Gospel of Thomas’s message
of the divine spark within us all. I found hope from breathing the mantra, “I
honor the Self within me.” We had both found Emerson’s God<b><i>.</i></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>I found more
than just hope from my meditation practice. I found that a structured,
disciplined spiritual practice provides tangible experiences – the sort of
inner experiences that provide balance to all of the “rough experience” life
throws at me from time to time. I have to admit that I squirm a bit when I read
Emerson’s famous “transparent eyeball experience”: “Standing on the bare
ground, - my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space, -
all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am nothing; I see
all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or
particle of God.”<sup> </sup>Although I squirm at the idea of the transparent
eye-ball, my heart sings at the thought of “I am part or particle of all that
is.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>I can never
fully explain how it is that the <i>kundalini </i>energy circulates through me confirming
that I am part of all that is. And I must confess that I sometimes find myself
worshipping external gods. I have practiced some type of meditation off and on
for more than thirty years, but I can make no claims to having reached and
maintained “the highest state, realization of your own inner divinity – the
Self” as is promised on my bookmark. It is as if I am still driving to find the
meditation center: sometimes I get lost, and sometimes I am reminded exactly
where it is. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Emerson, along
with other Transcendentalists, provides us with language that is <i>chaitanya</i>,
alive. This language can awaken in us an inner life that sustains us in our
daily lives and inspires us to be of service in the world. And as we witness to
this inner life that so many yearn for, we might even attract a few more
seekers to our shared journey. The rational mysticism of our tradition is a
gift to a world peopled by those who are tired of seeking external gods. It is
a gift for which I will always be grateful.</span></p>
