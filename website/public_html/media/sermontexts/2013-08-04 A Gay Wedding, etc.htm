<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Prior to vacation I announced three rules to all who were
about to visit me this year in California: 1. No discussing religion; 2. No
discussing politics and 3. No mention of my messy apartment. The third rule was
the easiest to keep; we didn’t stay long at my messy apartment, leaving almost
immediately to explore California. I didn’t put the first rule in place out of
some need to honor the guidelines of polite society. My work is religion. I
discuss religion pretty much every day. I was going on a vacation from
religion, therefore rule number one. Rule number two was put in place for much
the same reason. As a Unitarian Universalist my religious life is informed by
seeking justice in this world, not hoping for it to arrive in some ethereal
next world. I breathe in the issues of the day, hoping to breathe out peace for
myself, peace for those I serve and peace for the broken world. I was going on a
vacation from politics, too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Every time I broke one of the rules, my sister was quick to
point it out. I broke the first two rules immediately. As we set out on the
road to Northern California, immigration came up as both a religious and
political issue as we drove past the farm fields just yards from where I live. I
broke the rules again when I tried to talk about my daughters, who were still
reeling from their days spent protesting for women’s reproductive health at the
capitol in Austin, where they both live. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We were sitting in a hotel room in San Francisco when the
verdict in the George Zimmerman trial was announced on the nightly news. The
rules I had failed to establish didn’t matter anymore; there is no vacation
from being human. A sadness settled over us as we prepared to find a restaurant
for dinner. </span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";

</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“The prosecution never really had a case,” one of us said. “George
Zimmerman will have to live with the fact that he took another’s life for the
rest of <i>his</i> life,” another of us said. “Just another casualty of our gun
culture in America.” “Just another reminder of the legacy of slavery.” “Well,
the verdict was decided. Our justice system has spoken.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>This conversation may have continued at dinner, despite my
vacation rules. This conversation may have continued, except that it was a very
uncomfortable one without any clear consensus. This conversation may have
continued, except for the fact that we had no dinner reservations. “Forced” to
sit at the chef’s table at a restaurant, we sat at a counter not conducive to
having much of a conversation. Sitting, watching the restaurant’s meals being
prepared, the four of us stared ahead at the kitchen staff and the issue of
race in America stared back at us. The staff preparing our dinner were all
people of color, mostly Hispanic, with one Black gentleman preparing the
desserts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Like librarian and book blogger Joy Weese Moll, I am
uncomfortable joining in the cry of “I Am Trayvon Martin.” I understand the
need for a call to solidarity, but I also wonder if it might be better for a White,
middle-aged woman to examine what it means when I acknowledge that I am <u>not</u>
Trayvon Martin. I like to think I am not George Zimmerman either, but then who
exactly am I in this conversation about race in America and what should I say? Moll
suggests that white women over the age of 50 lead another rallying cry for
change with this alternative: &quot;I Am Not Afraid of Trayvon Martin.&quot; (<a

</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>When I see a black man while I’m in my car, I will not
reach for the automatic lock button. When I enter an elevator and there is a
young black man as the only other occupant I will not clutch my purse tightly
to my side. I will not assume there is danger where there is none. </span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>I will take responsibility for the assumptions I make based
on race and based on fear. I will not stand here in a hoodie and tell you that
“I Am Trayvon Martin” or that I have the potential to become a George
Zimmerman, but I will tell you that “I Am Not Afraid of Trayvon Martin,” hoping
that this rallying cry will start to make the change needed in our conversation
about race in this country.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Joy Weese Moll writes that, “The best antidote to fear is
education. Read <i>The Warmth of Other Suns</i> by Isabel Wilkerson, [the story
of the migration of almost six million black Americans who fled the South from
1915 to 1970] <i>Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria</i>
by Beverly Daniel Tatum, and <i>The New Jim Crow</i> by Michelle Alexander [a
book we have studied together as a congregation and as a faith movement].” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Beverly Daniel Tatum is a psychologist and president of
Spelman College, the nation’s oldest institution of higher education for Black
women. In her book, Tatum answers the question “Why Are All the Black Kids
Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?” along with other questions about race and
identity. And she helps this middle aged White woman better understand what it
means to be White without carrying the guilt for an entire racial group. She
explains that the human development task for Whites is to “develop a positive
White identity based in reality, not on assumed superiority.” According to
Tatum, I am to become more aware of my Whiteness, accept it and learn to feel
good about it “not in the sense of a Klan member’s ‘White pride,’ but in the
context of a commitment to a just society.” She goes on to write that in the
classes  and workshops she has taught on race, “Most of the White people I talk
to either have not thought about their race and so don’t feel anything, or have
thought about it and felt guilt and shame. These feelings of guilt and shame
are part of the hidden costs of racism” (p. 94).</span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>So why <u>are</u> all the Black kids sitting together in
the cafeteria? This is mostly a phenomenon that begins at adolescence, the time
when most young people are beginning to define their identity based on the
group to which they belong. At first all of our young children take in the
messages from a culture that values Whiteness. As the child grows she begins to
understand that her racial identity will have an impact on her future. Who
better understands her encounters with the realities of racism than other
adolescent peers experiencing similar realities? Black kids sit together in the
cafeteria, just as White kids, Hispanic kids, other kids of self-identified
groups because they need each other in response to a society that defines what
normal means. And living into society’s definition of normal, Whiteness being
the dominant cultural norm, is ultimately costly to us all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>But aren’t things getting better, you might ask? Aren’t we
in a post-racial era now? Aren’t we standing on the right side of history now
that we’ve elected a Black man to the presidency of the United States?  In his
remarks after the verdict, President Barack Obama acknowledged that yes things
are getting better, but we’re not in a post-racial society yet. When Trayvon
Martin was first shot and killed the president remarked that Trayvon could have
been his son. In his more recent remarks, he reflected that the boy who was
killed that night by George Zimmerman could have been him 35 years ago. He
reminded us that it is important to acknowledge that the African American
community sees the events that happened in Florida through a set of
“experiences and a history that doesn’t go away.” Then he said this, “There are
very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across
the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happen[ed] to
me -- at least before I was a senator.” </span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>It is not an exaggeration to link this common experience to
what happened the night that Trayvon Martin was killed. It is not exaggeration
to see this case in the context of a justice system that is infused with the
historic message that Whiteness is the norm to which everything is compared,
that Whiteness is superior.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>If we hadn’t been forced to sit at a counter facing our
meal being prepared rather than facing each other the night the verdict was
announced, I am not sure the conversation would have continued. It might have
been pointed out that we were breaking my rules again, this time as a way of
avoiding the discomfort with the conversation about race in America. In the end
my rules were pointless, there is no vacation from religion or politics, there
is no avoiding the realities of being human – no vacation from being human. Ours
is a religion that does not offer an escape from life, but instead promises
that we can be more fully alive when we face life as it is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>There is no “get out of hell free card,” even though I
could have picked one up on the second half of my vacation.  On the second half
of my vacation I attended San Diego’s Comic-Con International with my family
and about 150,000 fans attending this annual explosion of the popular arts. It
attracts fans of comic books, science fiction/fantasy books and science fiction
film/television, horror, animation, anime, collectible card games, video games,
webcomics, and independent artists who interpret all of the above. It also
attracts an odd collection of street preachers, some holding signs like “God
Destroys All Who Forsake Him” and signs condemning abortion, homosexuality and
Islam (together, on one sign) as the sources of evil in this country. There are
a variety of preachers from in your face, condemning you to hell to those
quietly passing out “get out of hell free cards” with instructions on the back
to believe in Jesus and the Bible as a means to escape the fiery pits. </span></p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif";
color:black'><br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Street preachers are a tradition at this decades-old event
and in recent years counter-protesters have begun appearing next to these self-righteous
evangelists trying to save people from hell. One woman held a hastily, handmade
sign with the words “Episcopalians welcome nerds.” The atheists were there with
professionally produced signs which read, “Religion the ultimate placebo
effect” and “These people are going to hell for annoying you at Comic Con.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Comic Con is meant to be a surreal experience, a culture
unto itself. It is an experience that promotes instant intimacy while standing
on line for hours with people you’ve never met before. United in a common love
for Doctor Who, Sherlock, Firefly, Wolverine, Battle Star Gallactica and yes,
even Snoopy, you bond for a short time with other humans at play. So to the
young man holding the sign that said, “Don’t be comic conned, your life is not
fiction, get real with Jesus,” I have this to say: “It’s my vacation and you’re
breaking the rules!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Here is my postscript on my postcard to you from my
vacation. PS: My colleague Theresa Novak and her long-time partner Anne
Spatola, while driving from Utah to California for their vacation, decided to
get married. It just so happened that they were vacationing near where we were.
On our way from Napa to San Francisco my husband Frank and I stopped off for a
brief legal ceremony to fulfill Theresa’s Facebook request for a colleague in
the area to marry them. I officiated, Frank was the witness and Theresa wrote a
poem for the occasion, which she read from her I-phone. Frank was also the
official event photographer. Anne and Theresa will have a formal wedding in
January with their four adult children present, but wanted the legal protection
that California now offers them as a married couple before that date.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>That morning as we were getting ready (luckily Frank always
travels with a suit), Frank remarked how good it felt to be on the right side
of history. Being on the right side of history is a tricky business, I reminded
him, because history is often written by the “winners.” There we were again,
breaking the rules, talking about religion and politics – humans at play,
making our way on the road towards something new.</span></p>
