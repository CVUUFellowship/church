<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Last week children
in our religious education classes stepped into other people’s shoes. Director
of Religious Education Justine Fischer took a trip to the Goodwill Store and
bought several pairs of shoes for the children to try on. This was an
opportunity for our children to try out what it is to live from this Native American
prayer, “Great Spirit, grant that I may not criticize my neighbor until I have
walked a mile in his moccasins.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Rather than
literally walking a mile in the ill-fitting, adult-sized shoes, the children
imagined who the person was that once owned those shoes, now donated to the Goodwill
Store, now no longer needed by the person who had once worn them. Our children
learned what Atticus Finch in the great American novel <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>
tried to teach his children, &quot;You never really understand a person until
you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and
walk around in it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Sympathy,
compassion and empathy are often used interchangeably. Sympathy is a general
alignment with another’s feelings. Compassion connotes a deep sympathy with
another’s sorrow, implying the desire to alleviate their suffering. “But what
is empathy?”  Professor Roman Krznaric asks and then answers this way, “It’s
the ability to step into the shoes of another person, aiming to understand
their feelings and perspectives, and to use that understanding to guide our
actions.” (<a
href="http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/six_habits_of_highly_empathic_people1#">http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/six_habits_of_highly_empathic_people1#</a>)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We make
assumptions when we see the shoes of another person – assumptions about gender,
class, race, education, occupation, and many others. Krznaric outlines the six
habits of highly empathic people and helps us step out of our assumptions into an
empathy that we can continue to develop throughout our lives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We need only
practice the following six habits: 1. Cultivate curiosity about strangers, 2.
Challenge prejudices and discover commonalities, 3. Try another person’s life,
4. Listen hard – and open up, 5. Inspire mass action and social change, and 6.
Develop an ambitious imagination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'> I remember the
first time my family encountered a transgender woman in church. I remember
because my pre-teen daughter leaned over and whispered, “Do you think that’s a
man?” A hard question to answer anywhere, but certainly made more difficult by
the situation in which we found ourselves: the quiet of the Sanctuary before
the service begins and the liberal church that supposedly teaches tolerance of
difference. My daughter’s curiosity was genuine, her application of it made
less compassionate by her innocent ignorance. Practicing the six habits of
highly empathic people takes work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><i>Nina Here Nor
There: My Journey Beyond Gender</i> is Nick Krieger’s memoir of his journey
from Nina to Nick, a journey that teaches all three of the concepts of sympathy,
compassion and empathy in a way that makes us understand why these terms are
not interchangeable. Beginning with our own curiosity, to enter the world
beyond gender we must learn a new vocabulary. We learn words like “cisgender,”
which is a label for individuals who have a match between the gender they were
assigned at birth, their bodies, and their personal identity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The world beyond
gender is a world that few of us can understand, but Nick helps us navigate it
with humor when he writes, “I envisioned the somber introductory music of a
special with Barbara Walters, the voiceover of her inquisitive rasp: ‘Tonight,
we have cisgender women – girls who wear dresses as children, dresses as
teenagers, and dresses as adults – how do they do it?’” (p. 193). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We can imagine the
shoes that go along with these dresses and begin to understand that Nick as
Nina was never comfortable in the shoes that were assigned to her at birth…him
at birth. Gender pronouns become confining in this new world. Curious about the
stranger sitting next to us on the bus, in the pew, in the theatre, we can also
be kind. We can refrain from using gender pronouns, or once our relationship
develops past that of a stranger, we can ask. There is the gender neutral “ze,”
which some prefer. We can ask.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Our Unitarian
Universalist tradition teaches us habit number two with the words and deeds of
prophetic women and men who have come before us. Habit number two - “Challenge
prejudices and discover commonalities” is invoked over and over again
throughout our history in our quest to bend the moral arc of the universe toward
justice. More than 150 years ago Unitarian and Transcendentalist Margaret
Fuller wrote, “Male and female represent the two sides of the great radical
dualism. But, in fact, they are perpetually passing into one another. There is
no wholly masculine man, no purely feminine woman.” These words continue to
challenge our prejudices and preconceptions. Yet, when we translate these words
into Nina’s world, into today’s world, we find ourselves confronted with the
second part of this habit: discover commonalities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Personally, I am
more able to feel empathy for Nina’s mother. When Nina’s mother comes to visit
for a week, she comes to help Nina recover from surgery. She is there to help
Nina recover from “top surgery,” the removal of her breasts. By the last day of
her visit to help her daughter recover from this life-altering surgery, Nina’s
mother returns home from a walk in the famous Castro neighborhood in San
Francisco. Sitting down in the living room she asks, “Is everyone in the Castro
gay?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>“What makes you think people are
gay?” I teased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I don’t know. The hand holding, the
couples. I can’t be sure. But they are, right?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“Yes, mom. I was just giving you a hard
time.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>“I’ve never been anywhere like it,” she
said. “It’s just different is all.” (p. 196)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>This mother/daughter dialogue could
happen anywhere, in almost any geographic location. It doesn’t need the Castro
to make sense. The focus doesn’t have to be a daughter’s journey beyond gender.
Most of our mothers have never been anywhere like the world’s we occupy. And at
some point many of us will find ourselves sitting in a child’s world, thinking
“this is different.” Finding commonalities in the gap between a mother’s
experience and her daughter’s life, we can step out of ourselves and into
empathy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Nina is determined
to share the history of her people with her mother – the secrets kept and the
stories relinquished to the edges of the past. She is determined to teach her
mother why so many lives have been made invisible. And when she tells her
mother that she is going to go by a new name, she lets them both off the hook
by waiting to reveal the new name until they are both ready to hear it said out
loud. We weep with them both, stepping into the shoes that we most recognize.
We weep with them both for the loss of Nina and for the vulnerability of Nick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>My own mother
would make us take our shoes off whenever we entered her house. We would line
our shoes up on a mat in the laundry room, honoring her request to keep her
carpets clean by this habit that had nothing to do with our ethnicity or some
time-honored custom. At some point my mother had opted for white carpet; we
lined our shoes up dutifully before we entered the rest of the house because
she didn’t want us to ruin her carpet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I thought of this
shoe line-up when I read Nick’s story. I pictured his mother slowly accepting
the new shoes that would replace the ones she had thought would be there for
years, lined up like so many obedient little soldiers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Highly empathic
people try on another person’s life. They expand their empathy by gaining
direct experience of someone else’s life. When I think of my daughter
whispering, “Do you think that’s a man,” I remember my own distance from the
woman sitting a few pews over. In the years to come I would preach from that
pulpit and look into this woman’s eyes as her transition became more evident.
Try on her life? Am I capable of that? It is difficult enough to read the
statistics from the National Transgender Day of Remembrance, held since 1999 each
year in November to memorialize those who have been killed due to
anti-transgender hatred or prejudice. </p>

</span></span>The murders are violent, often involving body mutilation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Listen hard and
open up. We usually think of listening as something passive, as doing nothing.
We want to help and fix, to do something. When we accompany someone on their
journey we can contribute listening. UU minister Jacob Trapp wrote: “To listen
to another person is to take seriously his otherness.” Our listening makes a
difference when we are willing to be vulnerable. Being vulnerable means we sit
with the discomfort of our own feelings, but do not respond. How many times
have we each responded to someone’s tale of woe with our own tale of woe?
Listening hard, we simply say “I’m sorry.” Opening up, we sit with someone
right where they are.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Habit 5: Inspire
mass action and social change. It has been several years since I looked out
from the pulpit into the eyes of the woman we whispered about in church. I have
looked out into the eyes of many a transgender person, some known and probably
some unknown to me. Unitarian Universalist congregations extend a warm welcome
to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals, families, and
communities. We are committed to protecting the civil and legal rights of LGBTQ
people and families across the country. Yet, many families have come to our
congregations thinking we are a safe place only to discover that we are more
comfortable with the LG and the B than we are with the T and the Q. Many have
come to our congregations and heard the whispers. Practicing the six habits of
highly empathic people takes work. Practicing the twelve steps to a
compassionate life takes work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Hoping to inspire
mass action and social change, this past June at our annual General Assembly of
UU congregations, we took over the Louisville Convention Center and changed the
majority of the restrooms to gender neutral. Temporary signs were posted covering
up the familiar blue signs that separate us into the usual binary definition of
gender.  One morning I encountered two older women clutching each other’s
hands, confused about which bathroom they should use. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It was an
incomplete experiment at best; you could tell which bathroom was which just by
glancing in quickly and determining if there were urinals and stalls or just
stalls. I reassured the women that were hesitating outside what would have been
the women’s restroom, had the UUs not been in town, and invited them to follow
me. It’s easy to make fun of our clumsy attempt to inspire mass action and
social change, but after a week of this social experiment many of us understood
what it must be like to be gender non-conforming and the risk of the simple
action of using a public restroom. The women I encountered that morning could
understand that risk better. They had walked in someone else’s shoes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Habit 6: Develop
an ambitious imagination. Justine’s project with the children asked them to
imagine the people who once wore shoes that were given away to the Goodwill
Store. Some were worn out, some were out of style, and some were dyed garish
colors. We imagine the stories behind the shoes and have empathy for those we
think are living on the margins. Certainly the next people to wear the shoes
are those possibly struggling with poverty; those who cannot afford a
full-price shoe store. What if Justine had cut out photos of really expensive
shoes? Or shoes that belong to people who hold different political views than
we do? What do those look like, exactly? What do the shoes of an oil company
executive look like? What do the shoes of a religious fundamentalist look like?
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Towards the end of
his journey beyond gender Nick Krieger discovered empathy. He acknowledges the
huge step his mother took to be with him for his surgery and then he writes,
“having my own needs fulfilled made me want to help those with fewer
opportunities and greater challenges, the people who weren’t like us.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The people who
aren’t like us are those with fewer opportunities and greater challenges. The
people who aren’t like us are also those who we count as our enemies. Stepping
out into empathy we leave the confines of our own suffering and enter into the
life of another. We begin to live from this prayer, “Great Spirit, grant that I
may not criticize my neighbor until I have walked a mile in his moccasins.”</p>
