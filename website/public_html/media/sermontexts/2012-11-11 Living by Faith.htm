<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It takes faith to speak the words you know are true.
It takes faith to use words that mean one thing to the listener, another to the
one who dares to speak. It takes faith to live into a deep not-knowing, the
free fall of life that never reaches solid ground.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Faith is one of those dangerous religious words that
has been defined for us. At times only belonging to our fathers, like in the
old hymn “Faith of Our Fathers.” At other times belonging only to those who
subscribe to traditional doctrines or believe in creedal statements that cannot
be proven. It is time for us to reclaim this word, knowing that the task of all
faith traditions is to learn trust – to restore faith in ourselves, each other
and in the vicissitudes of life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The anonymous author of the Letter to the Hebrews in
the Christian Bible defines faith as “the assurance of things hoped for, the
conviction of things not seen” (Heb 11:1). Theologian Paul Tillich wrote that
“Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned: the dynamics of faith are
the dynamics of [humankind’s] ultimate concern.” There is a popular Chinese
saying that translates to “The old man lost his horse.” This saying comes out
of the Taoist story about the farmer who experiences the vicissitudes of life -
life’s ups and downs - and refuses to claim them as either good or bad. In the
wisdom of the Tao, faith is derived from a calming assurance of the way things
are.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The succinct definition of faith from Hebrews
implies both belief and loyalty. In the pre-scientific world of first century
Christianity, believers were reassured by their experience of a world created
out of “things not seen.” They were also reassured by the stories from their
Jewish heritage that taught the faith of Israelite heroes. By faith Abraham
left Ur for Canaan, not knowing his destiny. By faith Moses left Egypt for the
Promised Land, but did not live to see it. The definitive example of faith for
early Christians would have been Jesus, of course, whose faithfulness led to
his death on the cross. The second generation Christians who would have heard
faith as “the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen”
would have experienced persecution and could have possibly been losing their faith
when they heard these words from the letter writer. The promised kingdom of God
had still not come. They needed reminding that faith could be defined as “the
assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Liberal religionists can reclaim the word faith when
we expunge the notion of belief from the definition and recognize ourselves in
the story of a man leaving his home to discover his destiny along the way. We
can own the word faith when we ask ourselves what cause we would be willing to
lead without knowing what can be accomplished in our lifetime. What are we
willing to die for? What is it that we give our faithfulness to? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“The assurance of things hoped for, the conviction
of things not seen” <u>can</u> be used to define a sort of blind faith that
asks little of its adherents. Or it can be a reminder, as it is in this piece
of scripture written two thousand years ago, of past events that developed
faith in the protagonists of three different heroes’ journeys. Listeners are
reminded that they too have past experiences that taught them faith. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is not that we are guaranteed a certain outcome
when we hope; it is that hope itself provides us assurance. Hoping itself is a kind
of promise. It is not that we believe in “things not seen” or invisible,
supernatural forces that govern the universe. It is that we have learned from
past experiences that we don’t always know everything. We doubt and we set out
on our journeys anyway. We learn faith, we learn to trust by stepping out and
being surprised when solid ground appears. We offer a sense of loyalty and
faithfulness to ourselves, each other and to all of life when we are willing to
learn that in the long run solid ground is only temporary, possibly only an
illusion. We live by faith when we honor the lessons of the past and move
gently into the future hoping and believing in “things not <i>yet</i> seen.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Having a child for the first time is a way to learn
faith, a faith that fits neatly the definition of “the assurance of things
hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” My first pregnancy came as a
surprise to both me and my husband. It was unplanned. Newly married, I would
watch people mentally count on their fingers how long we had been married when
I announced the upcoming blessed event. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I remember one conversation with my husband where I
expressed my unbelief: my fear of the unknown, my doubt in my ability not only
to parent, but to just be pregnant. He is an engineer. Grounded in science, he
reassured me that women had been giving birth since early humans arose out of
Africa nearly 160,000 years ago. My DNA was coded for carrying a child and
giving birth, he reassured me. I could have faith in myself, faith in science,
faith in evolution. The blob of cells causing me to be nauseous and anxious
would know what to do. My body would know what to do. I could be assured by a
hope that countless generations before me had experienced. I could trust in
things I could not see.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Paul Tillich, one of the most influential
theologians of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, defines faith as “the state of
being ultimately concerned: the dynamics of faith are the dynamics of
[humankind’s] ultimate concern.”  Our ultimate concerns are those that capture
our entire beings; they require total surrender and they promise ultimate
fulfillment. God is the ultimate concern for some. Their faith rests in the
commandment to “love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your
soul, and with all your might” (Deut. 6:5). </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Freedom from suffering is the ultimate concern for
others.  In Zen halls all over the world the fourfold vow of the bodhisattva is
recited by those whose ultimate concern is freedom from suffering:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sentient beings are numberless; I vow to free them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Delusions are inexhaustible; I vow to end them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Gates to the Truth are countless; I vow to open
them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Enlightened Way is unsurpassable; I vow to
embody it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At 29 weeks the baby stopped moving. We walked
through the groundlessness of the following days and weeks without faith in
anything except perhaps the passage of time. The autopsy of our little boy
didn’t provide any information. We moved forward in faith and were expecting
again within five months. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For some the ultimate concern is happiness. For
others enlightenment. Still for others it is wholeness: to be more fully alive
is their ultimate concern. “He who enters the sphere of faith enters the
sanctuary of life,” wrote Paul Tillich. In this way we decide what is holy. An
idolatrous faith distorts our ultimate concern with constraints of belief and
attachments to the material. When we enter the sanctuary of life we are
astonished that the holy is both comforting and disturbing. The holy is both
good and bad. And it is neither.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When someone has experienced deep pain, the Chinese
have a popular saying to share: “The old man lost his horse.” Likewise, when
someone has experienced great joy, they also say, “The old man lost his horse.”
It is a reminder of the faith embedded in a tale that comes from the
storytelling tradition influenced by Lao Tzu and the wisdom of the Tao. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A farmer’s horse runs off and his neighbor exclaims,
“How bad for you!” The farmer says, “I don’t’ know if it’s bad or if it’s
good.” The horse comes back with a wild mare that throws the farmer’s son and
breaks his legs. The neighbor says, “How bad for you!” The army comes to take
the young men from the village to fight a war. The neighbors’ two sons are
taken. The farmer’s son with his broken legs must remain at home. The neighbor
says, “How good for you.” The farmer says….The never-ending story reminds us
that we do not know, that living into a deep agnosticism pulls us forward in
faith.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When we are immersed in ultimate concern we do not
distinguish between good and bad. When we engage in a genuine act of faith we
do not judge the outcome as good or bad. We know from past experience that life
unfolds the way it does. We give up control. We surrender. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>My oldest daughter delights in telling the story of
her beginnings. “My father is an atheist,” she says, “and my mother is a minister.”
And then she pauses for effect, “they’re divorced.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“Sometimes the best thing to do is trust,” the poet
writes. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Wind finally gets where it was going</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>through the snowy trees, and the river, even</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>when frozen, arrives at the right place.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And sometimes you sense how faithfully your life</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is delivered, even though you can't read the
address. (“Trust” by Thomas R. Smith)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>My daughter tells her story often. It gets a good
laugh. She even told her story about being the daughter of an atheist and a
minister to Richard Dawkins at a book signing for his book, <i>The God
Delusion. </i>She embellished her account for his benefit, adding the fact that
her mother is a Unitarian Universalist minister. He seemed relieved for her. He
knows that we are a people of faith who are also a people of doubt. Paul
Tillich wrote that, “If faith is understood as being ultimately concerned,
doubt is a necessary element in it. It is a consequence of the risk of faith”
(“What Faith Is” in <i>The Essential Tillich </i>edited by F. Forrester Church).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>American Buddhist nun Pema Chodron’s teacher taught
that, “All is free fall and there is no ground to crash into.” This seems to be
the antithesis of the cliché, “What doesn’t kill you will make you stronger.”
If we surrender to free fall, then we never land. We don’t die. We do die one
day of course, but we don’t die now. Our lives don’t deliver atrocities to
either kill us or make us stronger. The horse runs away. The baby dies. We step
out in faith anyway. Sometimes the best thing to do is trust. We end up where
we are even when we can’t read the address.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We leave home not knowing what our destiny is and
somehow we still experience our destiny. We set out for the promised land and
end up wandering in the desert instead. We give ourselves away to something
larger, emptying ourselves of who we thought we were. We live into a way of
being that teaches us to trust, to be loyal and to be faithful to each other
and a set of principles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It takes faith to extract belief from a definition
of faith that belongs in the past. It takes faith to use religious words in a
new way. It takes faith to live into a deep not-knowing, into the free fall of
life that never reaches solid ground.</p>
