<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In an online course I took with Unitarian
Universalist historian and Minister Rev. Mark W. Harris we had weekly
assignments to write on subjects ranging from the centrality of covenant in our
faith to the practice and ethics of ministry. One week we were given a choice.
In the week exploring rites of passage we were asked to submit a brief paper on
our theology of death, explaining what we, as ministers, were trying to do in a
memorial service. OR we could write about our theology of marriage. I chose
death.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When David Wood won the right in last year’s annual
service auction to assign the subject matter of one of my sermons, he did not
give me the choice between death and marriage. He wanted me to preach about a
theology of marriage from the perspective of our liberal faith. I still would
prefer to preach about death, but a promise is a promise and a promise made in
the context of our community is a promise worth keeping.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The institution of marriage continues to evolve.
This is the subject of E.J. Graff’s book <i>What Is Marriage For?</i> published
by Beacon Press in 1999 and again in 2004. E.J. is a journalist and writer who
weaves her personal story in and out of the social history of marriage as an
institution. She married her partner Madeline in a friend’s living room in the
traditional month of June. She writes that </p>

was nearly a delirium: by accident we’d spilled into something sacred. …To our
utter surprise, the ceremony did bring us closer, pulling an invisible cloak
around us that has warmed us during difficult times. We’d thought ourselves as
committed as any couple could be: how else could we have exposed ourselves to
the world’s ridicule? But now even the most subtle traces of doubt dissolve
instantly, chased away by the memory of that day when we made our declarations
so publicly, placing our love in the hands of God and everyone we knew. (p.

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A theology of marriage for liberal religion most
definitely includes same-sex marriage. This may be a “no-brainer” for most of
us here, having traced our own religious roots as dissenters from the seven
sacraments of the Catholic Church, which included marriage, through the
Protestant Reformation’s two sacraments, which no longer included marriage, to
contemporary liberal religion which recognizes rites of passage but no longer
contains proscribed sacraments. In tracing the history of marriage from legal
contract in order to preserve property to an act made holy by the church, E.J.
Graff celebrates the gift in her own life that married priests after the
Reformation began to preach: “marriage, that difficult and daily attempt to
treat each other well, could be a spiritual act that pleased God.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Yes, as Unitarian Universalists we affirm the rights
of same-sex couples to marry. We work for it, carry signs for it, wear yellow
t-shirts and stand on the side of love for it. And that is where, for many of
us, our theology of marriage ends. When we answer the question, “What Is
Marriage For?,” we think in terms of what makes us happy, what personally
fulfills us and what serves our own needs as evolving human beings. We avoid
thinking in terms of marriage as a spiritual act, practice or discipline. We
know that many marriages end in divorce, the condemnation of which belongs to
more conservative religions than ours. As a minister I know that many marriages
end in divorce, including my own first marriage. This is why I’m more
comfortable describing my theology of death than my theology of marriage. When
a person dies, those left behind form a community of grief that can find
comfort in each other’s presence. When a marriage dies, those left behind are
often asked to take sides. Children are emotionally, if not also physically,
abandoned. Hearts are broken. The remnants of community after a marriage ends
in divorce are often harder to heal, harder to put back together than
communities mourning a death.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>   We are promise-making, promise-breaking,
promise-renewing creatures, according to theologian Martin Buber. The covenant
of marriage is a promise made in community. When that promise is broken, the
community is challenged to respond in a way that reflects the values of that particular
community. The response may be stronger in a religious community clearly
defined by shared beliefs. In a liberal religious community such as ours, one
defined by shared values rather than beliefs, the response becomes more
complicated. My theology of marriage includes how a community can respond when
promises are broken. My theology of marriage is also shaped, surprisingly, by
how a non-denominational evangelical Christian community in Dallas used what is
known as the “Matthew 18 Process” as their response to one couple whose
promises to each other fell apart and became a very public witness to the
ethics of community.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Several years ago, while I was serving as director
of development for a substance abuse treatment center for economically
disadvantaged women, I was approached by a member of a growing church called
Watermark Community Church. The church was, and still is, headed up by a Joel
Osteen-like charismatic preacher by the name of Todd Wagner. Pastor Wagner
encouraged each member of his growing flock to follow their passion to create
outreach into the Dallas community. Once a member created a project, the church
would get on board with volunteer and monetary support. I was approached by a
hair stylist from one of Dallas’ most elite hair salons. Paul found out about
our agency when he was helping to assemble “goodie bags” for our annual
fundraiser that attracted the well-coiffed along with the well-heeled of
Dallas. He wanted to do something other than give away bottles of shampoo to
wealthy Dallasites paying high ticket prices to hear a national speaker at a
luncheon. He wanted to do something tangible for the lost and the hurting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For the next five years I worked closely with Paul
to create an annual event known as “Glow:  A Day of Beauty &amp; Encouragement
for Women.” During those five years we became friends. He also became my hair
stylist. I even invited him to my ordination. He was unable to come, which
quite honestly may have changed our relationship if he had attended. For five
years we had a somewhat unspoken agreement. We never unpacked our theologies
beyond recognizing the common ground we shared in our care for the “least of
these.” And we never mentioned the lawsuit that had erupted when a former
member sued his church for breach of confidentiality.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The first year I worked with Paul and Watermark
Community Church they were outgrowing their rental space in a local high school
auditorium. They had just purchased expensive property along the LBJ Freeway
including two buildings that had been the headquarters of a restaurant chain.
The property included adjacent vacant land where they would later build two
worship spaces for what would become their more than 6,000 member congregation.
The first year of our event temporary sinks to wash hair were installed in what
was once a kitchen for the building, and another floor was transformed into a
health fair.  Our clients had the opportunity to have their hair cut, colored
and styled, and to receive manicures, facials, massages and make-up. Paul
assembled a host of volunteers including an entire beauty school, local hair
stylists and of course, volunteers from the church. The second year the event
was held on a floor of one of the newly renovated buildings that had been
specifically designed with the event in mind: plumbing was included for temporary
hair salon sinks and extra electrical capacity was added for multiple blow
dryers and curling irons. Pastor Todd Wagner put the wealth and the commitment
of the community behind his word: if you were a member of the church and had a
project that made a difference in the Dallas community, the church would be
your partner.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Watermark Community Church commits to being your
partner in other ways as well. Their vision is to call all people to be fully
devoted followers of Christ. They believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, the
Trinity, Jesus as the only way to salvation and that Christ will come again.
They also value commitment, authenticity and accountability in their church
members. This is not my interpretation of who they are; this is who they say they
are on their web site.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In 2006 a member went to the pastor for guidance after
she discovered her husband was having an affair. At first the pastor counseled
that they reconcile. When this failed, the pastor allegedly shamed the man from
the pulpit and, again allegedly, threatened to send letters to people that both
the man and his girlfriend knew in the wider Christian community. The pastor
was following a common practice among evangelical Christians, a process based on
Matthew 18:15-18:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>If
another member of the church sins against you, go and point out the fault when
the two of you are alone. If the member listens to you, you have regained that
one. But if you are not listened to, take one or two others along with you, so
that every word may be confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If
the member refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if the
offender refuses to listen even to the church, let such a one be to you as a
Gentile and a tax-collector. (Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will
be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>I read this passage to you
within our context of the study of covenant. Last week we read our Covenant of
Good Relations aloud to each other affirming such promises as:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Speak honestly and directly to the person(s) with whom I have a
concern, using thoughtful, compassionate language.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Listen deeply to, and actively seek resolution with those
concerned before engaging the Conflict Resolution Committee, Committee on
Ministry, the Council or the Board of Trustees in conflict mediation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:normal'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Expect divergent beliefs and opinions and persist in respectful
dialogue—especially in times of uncertainty—remaining open to new
understandings while doing my part to sustain this Covenant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-indent:0in'>There are some similarities
to these two ways of being in religious community. There are major differences
as well. We do not practice a rules-based ethic that calls for us to cast out a
member as if they were a “Gentile or a tax-collector.” Rather, ours is a
values-based ethic that encourages “a free and responsible search for truth and
meaning.” </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The danger is that we fall into a sort of anything
goes attitude when it comes to marriage or other commitments we fail to take
seriously in our antiauthoritarian rejection of what we perceive as rigid,
rule-based religions. Marriage and family therapist William J. Doherty, writing
in the <i>UU World</i> magazine, invites us to consider a theology of marriage
that challenges our propensity towards Jonathan Swift’s “anythingarianism.” Doherty
writes, </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>I
come to this conversation as a big fan of marriage, both same-sex and straight,
and with a background as a Catholic seminarian, a Unitarian Universalist for
twenty-seven years, a university professor, and a practicing marriage and
family therapist. With this history, I feel I have gone through a kind of
whiplash on marriage during my adult life. As a Catholic, I knew marriage was a
permanent covenant and a sacrament. As a new UU and liberal professional, I
decided that marriage was not so special--just a personal lifestyle that should
not be subjected to so much social pressure about entering and exiting.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>Now
after thirty-three years of marriage to the same woman and a career working
with couples in distress, I see lifelong marriage as a countercultural act in a
throwaway society. Without ignoring the shadow side of marriage and the pain of
divorces that cannot be avoided, we religious liberals can support marriage and
shape its future according to liberal ideals. (<i>UU World</i>, 2005)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As I consider my evolving theology of marriage, I
look to the liberal ideals that I can include. One is an acknowledgment that
affirming a respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which we are
a part means that a lot of people get hurt when a divorce occurs. The
interdependent web includes children, friends, co-workers and church
congregations. Justice, equity and compassion in human relations means that we
redefine old patriarchal models of marriage. It also means that when a marriage
dissolves we work hard to make sure that our compassion for all those affected
does not dissolve at the same time as the marriage does. When we “place our
love in the hands of God and everyone we know,” as E.J. and Madeline did more
than 20 years ago, we open ourselves to the possibility that transcending
mystery and wonder can be found in marriage. We create what poet Robert Bly
calls “The Third Body”: “A man and a woman sit near each other… They obey a
third body that they share in common. They have promised to love that body.” As
their religious community we promise to love that body too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is an epilogue to the story of how a
non-denominational, evangelical church shaped my theology of marriage. For five
years I worked closely with many of the elders of the church. All of the elders
are men; it is in their doctrinal statement that only men will serve in that
role. This is consistent with their Bible-centered faith. My last year of
involvement with the church I grew bold and mentioned that I was attending
seminary. One of the elders asked me why, what did I plan to do with a Master
of Divinity degree. I replied that I was going to be a minister. The
conversation abruptly ended.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Several months later I saw this same elder at an
event for the recovery community. Not wanting to open up the previous
conversation, I deliberately avoided him. He, however, made a point of joining
me at my table and asking if we could talk after the event was over. What
happened then was a sort of confession. He wanted me to know that he and his
wife had been told to leave Watermark Community Church; that they had disagreed
with the use of “The Matthew 18 Process.” He felt I needed to know this because
I was becoming a minister. He wanted me to know how churches can behave
sometimes. He felt compelled to warn me. I think he also wanted me just to
listen to his story. He needed a pastoral presence to bear witness to his pain.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A liberal theology of marriage acknowledges the pain
we can cause each other in community when we break our promises to each other.
A liberal theology of marriage also acknowledges that the covenant made between
two people in marriage is a sacred promise, one that is held in trust by a Love
that dwells within us, among us and beyond us, always renewing and transforming
us as we become more fully human.</p>
