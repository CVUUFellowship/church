<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This church year we are igniting a sacred fire
dedicated to exploring a full range of theological themes both in worship and
in religious education. Starting next week we’ll begin a shared examination of
the Reverend Tom Owen-Towle’s book <i>Theology Ablaze </i>with a series of
theological themes that will inspire our worship, inform all of our religious
education and spark a flame of inquiry in our hearts and minds as we journey
together this church year.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It all begins now as we return from our summer
travels and our summer sabbaths, we ask each other, “What have you brought to
this sanctuary today to preserve the flame that burns brightly on this hearth,
even when we are far away?” Passing the flame from candle to candle and heart
to heart we are affirming the mission of this congregation as we start a new
year. We are, in a paraphrase of John O’Donohue’s words, discovering beneath
our fear the embers of anger to kindle justice. We are breathing “new urgency
into our love of life” and allowing the “flame of passion to burn away what is
false.” We are proclaiming and praying, “May courage cause our lives to flame.”
(“In Praise of Fire”)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And so we say together, “May courage cause our lives
to flame.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Even now a volcano in Nicaragua is expelling an ash
cloud into the atmosphere, causing hundreds of nearby residents to be
evacuated. A fire that broke out last Sunday afternoon in the Angeles National
Forest is just now nearly contained. Fires in Colorado this summer caused
devastating damage that will take years to rebuild. Fire is a powerful element.
We invoke it with great care.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The fire of the big bang lives on in the earth’s
core that rumbles and tumbles out in the ash cloud of a volcano. The heat of
our bodies connects us to this original fire. The fireball that is the sun
travels to us at a great distance, cooling down on its way so that life can be
sustained on our tiny blue-green planet.  The first humans harnessed the power
of fire, some worshipped it and named it as a god. Fire is a powerful element.
We invoke it with great care. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Our ancestors gathered around fires made sacred by
shared stories. The stories in turn became sacred as they carried the evolving
wisdom arising out of the collective heartache of wandering tribes. As people
moved into settlements they brought the fire inside to the hearth, the center
of family life. Irish poet and philosopher John O’Donohue tells us that some family
fires have never been extinguished. Through a practice called “smooring” live
embers are kept aflame beneath a layer of ash. From generation to generation,
the hearth remains ablaze. From generation to generation, the sacred fire lights
up the darkness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>We gather today, coming home to this sanctuary,
where we light a chalice each Sunday reminding ourselves of the ancient symbol
of the flame burning in the temple, the lamps burning on altars, the sacred
bonfires burning in the wilderness. How will we keep our sacred fire ablaze
together this year? How will we honor the live embers of our faith that has
been passed from generation to generation? Coming to this place where our heart
is at home, returning to this intentional community of spiritually courageous
people, we say together “May courage cause our lives to flame.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“May courage cause our lives to flame.” The element
of fire invites us to face our fears of irrevocable loss, devastating
humiliation and the painful judgment of others.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“May courage cause our lives to flame.” The desire
to be loved blazes in our hearts. The desire to be heard, to speak our truth
without fear of reprisal, to stand up for what is right, burns brightly.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“May courage cause our lives to flame.” We need the
fire of courage to love ourselves boldly, to sift through the ashes of what is
false for that one spark of truth, and to endure with strength the trials and
tribulations of a life willing to be formed by the sacred fire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“May courage cause our lives to flame.” Seeking
always for more awareness of the holy fire within, seeking and doubting, having
the courage to live the question, living in the “I don’t know” of life, we say
together:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>“May courage cause our lives to flame.” Trusting in
a sacred passion that calls us to transform the world through justice and
compassion, we say together:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>May courage cause our lives to flame.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Being passionately ablaze with the life force that
fuels transformation, we say together one last time:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>May courage cause our lives to flame. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><b>As we engage in our final ritual, I will bring
the light of the chalice to you. Share it with each other. Share your courage
with each other. Re-light each other’s flames, keeping the candles burning
through the final hymn.</b></p>
