<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='font-size:16.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span>Dear
James: It may seem strange to write a letter to my ex-husband the atheist the
week I have resigned from the congregation I serve as a minister, but I need a
context in which to place my struggles of late and what better place than the
polarizing argument between atheism and theism? You, my ex-husband the atheist,
have become a character in several of my sermons, serving as a foil to my pious
religiosity. First of all, I am not really piously religious and secondly I
know you are more than a character in my sermons. You, of all the people in my
life, understand that there is more nuance in most polarizing arguments than opponents
would like to admit. Our daughters like to astonish their friends by saying,
“My father is an atheist and my mother is a minister, pausing for effect …
they’re divorced.” You and I both know that it’s a bit more complicated than
that. Life is more complicated than that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I was reminded how complicated life is the last time
I visited Dallas and sat with Emily’s daughter Aida while she played with a box
of art supplies that once belonged to our daughter Sarah. Here’s how
complicated it gets: do I call Aida my step-granddaughter or do I, like many
have suggested, drop the “step” because it just confuses the matter? How
confusing was it for my step-children to hang out with our children at your
mother’s house on New Year’s Eve while they were growing up so the complicated
array of parents could get a break? When Aida was born, you and Fran sent a
gift. You, my ex-husband the atheist, and Fran, your second wife, even attended
my ordination to the Unitarian Universalist ministry. You can’t get much more complicated
than that. Sitting with Aida, sifting through the contents of a box our
daughter decorated with stickers, feeling the rubbery remnants of a pink eraser
with Sarah’s name etched in it, I was in awe at the way we have patched
together our family with Elmer’s Glue and stickers. And this is why I have
decided to leave a job that I felt called to do and to return home to Dallas. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Some will see the “hand of god” in this and some
will not. I do not, and here is why. But, first I have to share with you a long
story and a metaphor. I know that atheists and humanists prefer facts to
metaphors, but I’m hoping that in the argument between metaphor and reason,
that love wins.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When I was a child growing up in Illinois, one
summer our task was to capture as many fireflies as we could, put them into
glass jars and then store them in our freezer. My mother had stumbled across an
article in the paper about some scientific study that would pay for fireflies.
I cannot imagine that the pay was very much; nevertheless, my sisters and I,
who ranged from the age of eight to twelve, had few other options to earn money
so we spent most of that summer in our backyard catching fireflies. To catch a
firefly one must wait until dusk. The trick is to have enough light to be able
to navigate in your surroundings, but not too much light so you can’t see the
fireflies light up. As soon as you see a lit firefly you have to run towards it
and clasp your hands around the space you assume it occupies. Slowly you open
your hands just a bit, waiting for a burst of light to confirm the presence of
the firefly. Most of the time your hands grasp empty air, but if conditions are
right – dusk has just fallen, the night is thick with fireflies, your grasp is
particularly quick – you come up with the prize.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Capturing an experience of God with words is a bit
like catching fireflies. The experience itself is elusive. Standing in the
dark, waiting for a burst of light, we think we have it within our grasp, but
we come up empty-handed so many times. And so, you see, I cannot argue for the
existence of God with logic – only through experience and metaphor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Feminist scholars of religion look to the experience
of women and their struggle for justice as an oppressed group as authority for
the interpretation of truth. “The source of authority concerning revelation is
not Scripture or Jesus Christ but the experience of struggle of women for
justice.… Revelation is given to the experience of women, and they do not have
to go outside their own experience to encounter truth,” according to <i>Essentials
of Christian Theology</i> (p. 47), one of the many books I was required to read
in seminary.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>My own experience is unfortunately an all too common
one for many women. The portrait of that family of young girls innocently catching
fireflies on summer evenings in the 1970s hides an ugly and violent reality. My
own “dark night of the soul” that I experienced as a result of this hidden
truth lasted for several years as an adult. Addicts speak of “hitting bottom”
as the moment they realize that their addiction has become unmanageable and
they are finally ready for help. Although I am not an addict, I had a similar
experience of “hitting bottom.” When I was in my mid-twenties I found myself in
the depths of depression and can only describe this somewhat inadequately as a
feeling of finding myself at the bottom of a well looking up and crying for
help. It was when I stopped looking up and looked across from myself and I saw
God sitting there with me at the bottom of the well, that I realized my cries
had been heard. I have defined and re-defined that god so many times since
then; you might be surprised how close my position on god now comes to yours,
my dear ex-husband the atheist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>American Buddhist nun and teacher Pema Chödrön
writes,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>The
difference between theism and nontheism is not whether one does or does not
believe in God. It is an issue that applies to everyone, including both
Buddhists and non-Buddhists. Theism is a deep-seated conviction that there’s
some hand to hold: if we just do the right things, someone will appreciate us
and take care of us. … Nontheism is relaxing with the ambiguity and uncertainty
of the present moment without reaching for anything to protect ourselves. We
sometimes think that dharma is something outside of ourselves – something to
believe in, something to measure up to. However, dharma isn’t a belief; it
isn’t dogma. It is total appreciation of impermanence and change. </p>

also writes: <br>
For those of us who want something to hold on to, life is even more
inconvenient. From this point of view, theism is an addiction. We’re all
addicted to hope – hope that the doubt and mystery will go away. This addiction
has a painful effect on society: a society based on lots of people addicted to
getting ground under their feet is not a very compassionate place. (<i>When
Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times</i>, pp. 39-40).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I have preached many times about impermanence,
quoting from Pema Chodron, other Buddhists and from my own tradition’s Ralph
Waldo Emerson. In counseling sessions I will often advise people to get
Chodron’s book, <i>When Things Fall Apart</i>, writing it down with other book
titles on a notepad with my name on it, as if I’m some sort of doctor of the
spirit writing out a prescription for better living. The first time I quoted
from <i>When Things Fall Apart</i> in a sermon, someone came up to me
afterwards and said she and her husband had just read the book and felt like
the “rug had been pulled out from underneath them.” I replied that I had
already felt as if the rug had been pulled out from underneath me before
reading the book, so found it to be deeply reassuring and comforting. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The image of having the rug pulled out from
underneath one brings to mind the picture of someone standing securely on a rug
and then suddenly, without warning that astonished someone is sitting
confounded on the floor. Impermanence is more than that. It is as Pema’s
teacher Chogyam Trungpa taught her: everything is freefall and there is no
solid ground to crash into. There is nothing to hold on to. The truth is
inconvenient.  Life is complicated.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The god I found at the bottom of the well with me
taught me there was something to hold on to. The gods I have encountered since
then have taught me an appreciation of impermanence and change. What’s the
difference between atheism and nontheism this mess of metaphors may have you
asking? Have I taken the cowards’ way out by claiming to be a nontheist rather
than an atheist? Why not just call myself an agnostic and be done with it? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Because ultimately it does not matter to me whether
god exists or not; what matters is how we treat each other. I am not arguing
for or against atheism. I am arguing for not knowing. I am arguing for
uncertainty. I really do believe and know, based on experience, that it is all
freefall and there is no solid ground upon which to land. What I would like to
know definitively is if no god means no love. Not love with a small l, but Love
with a big L, the kind of love that holds us on the way down. If all there is is
freefall, impermanence, and uncertainty, can any religion promise me that I am
held by a larger love that holds me while the rug is being pulled out from
underneath me time after time after time? Are we held by Love or are we not
held at all? Am I trying to reconcile two distinct religious world views that
cannot be reconciled?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Here is one thing I know with certainty: Emily has a
brain tumor. The kind of brain tumor she has is called anaplastic astrocytoma.
Many people this week, out of their concern for Emily and my family, have asked
what her prognosis is. Science has answers to that question and you can look
those up for yourself on Wikipedia and elsewhere online. Since I’m a minister,
not a scientist, I will give you the religious response to that question. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What’s her prognosis? Same as yours. “Same as
yours,” the poet and UU minister Nancy Shaffer wrote in her reflections upon
facing her own death from a brain tumor. “Same as yours,” she wrote: “eventual
death; but a potentially rich time before that!” She also wrote, “Always an
entering into mystery: knowing nothing in order to know fully.” And then this:
“I will live with uncertainty always.” (<i>While Still There is Light</i>)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Like you, I rail against religions that deny science
and imbue prayer and ritual with some sort of magical effect. Unlike you, and
I’m only guessing here, I have a sacramental view of the world: a sacramental
view of the world means that many ordinary moments can reveal a larger love
that some would call God. I reject the sort of “magical thinking” that imbues
all rituals with some sort of guaranteed effect. I do not reject the idea that
rituals can become sacraments, however. I have experienced some profound
baptisms and communion celebrations that became profound not because of a supernatural
being that gave them extra meaning, but because of the human beings that
endowed them with meaning. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>One baptism that was particularly sacramental for me
was Emily’s adult baptism in the Catholic Church. She had never been baptized
and before she could take her first communion, she had to be baptized. It was
during the long Easter Vigil service (made longer by the fact that we had all
driven down that day from Dallas to College Station for the service). Her
mother (Frank’s ex-wife), her step-father, her father, her half-sister, her
sister, her Catholic fiancée, both her grandmothers and I filled one whole pew.
(Side note: her Catholic fiancée is now her ex-husband – another sign of the
complicated life.) </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At one point the priest asked the congregation to
hold hands as we joined in prayer. I was sitting in between Frank and his
ex-wife, Becky. Emily’s half-sister was asleep, half on Becky’s lap, half on
mine. I held Becky’s hand on my left and Frank’s hand on my right. Ritual had
become sacrament - an outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible
grace. In community we can be drawn together as one. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In religious community, regardless of the ritual, we
can become one when we feel a shared sense of loss or when we feel a shared
sense of love – when we share any felt sense. UU minister and Zen priest James
Ishmael Ford writes, “I’ve found how the (Zen) Buddhist two truths that
everything and everybody in the universe is mutually created through a dance of
causality, and that everything and everybody in the universe has no substance,
but rather is wildly open, boundless results in an experience of love.”  Religion,
at its best, opens us up to the promise of a larger love even as we are
embracing impermanence and change.</p>
