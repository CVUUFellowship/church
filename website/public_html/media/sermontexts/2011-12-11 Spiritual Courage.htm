religion that calls itself a movement. Welcome all you spiritual but not religious
people. You are welcome here.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>And you are not alone. Anywhere between 10 and 33 percent of Americans
call themselves SBNR, spiritual but not religious. It is their attempt to
separate themselves from institutional religion, which after all doesn’t have
such a great track record. It is their declaration of independence from an
outside authority. SBNRs look to the findings of science and reject the creeds
of the church. The spiritual but not religious folks find God in the sunsets,
the sacred in walks on the beach, according to United Church of Christ pastor
Lillian Daniel. “Like people who go to church don't see God in the sunset! Like
we are these monastic little hermits who never leave the church building. How
lucky we are to have these geniuses inform us that God is in nature. As if we
don't hear that in the psalms, the creation stories and throughout our deep
tradition,” she writes.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Rev. Daniel has stirred up quite a response with her sarcastic remarks.
UU minister Kathy Schmitz commented that “Snarky, derisive behavior and
eye-rolling may sell better, but it does not represent our best selves and it
does not represent either community or religion at its best.” I agree with both
my colleagues. Sarcasm divides <u>and</u> we have something to say to those
identifying themselves as spiritual but not religious.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>First of all, it is a twentieth century invention to define spiritual
as something different from religious. As more people became disenchanted with
the spirituality found in organized religion – supernatural gods they no longer
believed in, empty rituals they no longer practiced and truth claims that
couldn’t stand the test of science – they struck out on their own. They
constructed personal spiritual practices that were separate from institutions.
Spiritual became associated with private beliefs and practices; religious meant
public. Even more so: spiritual was good and religious was bad. And so I say,
welcome to a religion that helps you redefine words like God, spiritual and even
religion. Welcome to all you spiritual but not religious folks out there.
Welcome to a place that nurtures spiritually courageous people who transform
the world through justice and compassion.</span></p>

lang=EN>When the board of trustees and I sat with the results of the survey,
the cottage conversations and the one-on-ones I have been having with you, we
sat with our own hearts hoping to be open to a mission statement that came from
the depths of who this community is. This community – a religious community –
who when asked what spiritual and religious practices are important in your
life this is how you responded: 76% responded that communing with nature is
important to you. These will not add up to 100% because there is overlap; many
of you have more than one spiritual practice. Sixty-five percent of you count
service to others as a spiritual practice. Fifty-two percent marked creativity
and artistic expression in the survey as a spiritual and religious practice.
And 47% of you practice some sort of meditation. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Here is what you expect from a worship service: you want fellowship and
friendship, inspiration and insight, intellectually challenging ideas and an
uplifting emotional experience. Thirty-six percent of you want to recharge your
spiritual batteries. But spiritual means different things to all of you. From
nature to service you, like our spiritual but not religious friends, are free
to explore that word. Unlike our spiritual but not religious friends, you have
a cloud of witnesses to help you with that definition. We have the many sources
upon which we draw to inform our spiritual journeys, define our terms and to
create our living tradition.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Almost all religious traditions have a term for Spirit, the indwelling
power in each of us that connects us to all that is. Practitioners of yoga call
it Kundalini. The Japanese call it ki, the Chinese chi, and in Christianity it
is known as the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, the third person in the classic
doctrine of the Trinity is that which sustains us in our daily lives. It is the
sacred not as creation or as redemption; it is the sacred as connection. To
experience this connection with all that is, we must first experience
connection to ourselves. Perhaps this is why spirituality has become so
personal. Yet to experience this connection to all that is, we must also step
out of who we are and recognize the Spirit that is also in our neighbor.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Spirit is ruah, Hebrew for breath or wind. When translated to Greek it
becomes pneuma. Spirit is what inspires us (breath, inspire, inspiration)…
spirit is what inspires us to make meaning of our lives. Spirit, infused in
religion, brings connection and inspiration into our communal worship
experiences.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>“The
spirit,” writes poet Mary Oliver “likes to dress up like this: ten fingers, ten
toes, shoulders, and all the rest.” She writes this in a poem she titles “Poem.”
Of the thousands of poems Oliver has written during the last fifty years, she
titles this one poem “Poem.” As if to say, “all poetry is metaphor and this one
is a Metaphor with a capital M. This is a metaphor about a metaphor and it’s
not the metaphor you expect it to be.” The spirit, not a real thing, is a
metaphor for that which inspires and connects us to all that is. In Oliver’s
“Poem” the spirit needs the metaphor of the body. We know that the body, “with
[its] lime and appetite, [its] oceanic fluids” is the real “thing.” In “Poem,”
Oliver reverses our expectations. It is the body that is the metaphor to the
spirit, which is an “airy and shapeless thing.” The spirit needs the body and
is lit up by the mornings, the awakenings of our understandings. And at night,
in the dark nights of our souls, the spirit lights us up.
Spirit…ruah…breath…inspiration, indwelling connection to all that is needs us
as much as we need it.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Our
mission is to nurture spiritually courageous people who transform the world
through justice and compassion. It is not to nurture secularly courageous
people or courageously spiritual people, for that matter. Quite specifically we
acknowledge that the spiritual questions we ask about where the universe comes
from, why we are here, or what happens when we die, require courage. When we
live out of these questions without definitive answers and when we live out of
these questions with a sense that our one life matters, we are called to spiritual
courage.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>We
are called to the sort of spiritual courage that “Victim Number 1” must have been
called to. Victim Number 1 is not the first apparent victim of former Penn
State football coach Jerry Sandusky. But he is the first courageous young man
to step forward and tell his truth about the alleged sexual abuse he suffered.
Alleged, because one aspect of this truth will be determined in a court of law.
Courageous, because by coming forward he started the investigation. Spiritually
courageous, because his actions provide a space for his own healing.
Spiritually courageous, because his speaking out may have saved other boys from
becoming victims.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This
is not the sort of spiritual courage we are called to every day. It is the sort
of spiritual courage that can inspire us, however. Victim Number 1 is
spiritually courageous. And in reading the accounts of other victims of the
Penn State tragedy, there may be no other word for it but tragedy, we are
reminded of our own pain, our own spiritual courage to heal and what we hope
would be our own spiritual courage to speak up. We are reminded of Edmund
Burke’s famous quote: “The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good
men to do nothing.” Spiritually courageous people do something. Spiritually
courageous people act. Spiritually courageous people encounter the sacred in a
real human community.</p>

Lillian Daniel’s full reflection on what it means to be spiritual but not
religious appeared in the September issue of <i>The Christian Century</i>. It
is less “snarky” than the shorter, blogged version that upset so many. In it
she writes about a man who left the church he was attending after his marriage
ended, feeling that the church belonged more to his former wife than it did to
him. He started to sleep in on Sunday mornings and to take a run in the woods
instead of attending church. He found God in the woods and realized he too,
like so many, was now deeply spiritual but no longer religious. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
lang=EN>Only about half of Unitarian Universalists attend Sunday services
regularly (Michael Durall, <i>The Almost Church Revitalized</i>). Like the man
who found God on his morning run in the woods, we often substitute communing
with nature for attending church. Remember the statistic from our
congregation’s survey? Seventy-six percent of this congregation responded that
communing with nature is important. Spiritually courageous people attend church
on a regular basis. I realize that I am preaching to the people who are
attending church right now. Spiritually courageous people also tell others that
they are missed when they do not attend church on a regular basis. Spiritually
courageous people confront those who want to contribute something to the
community, but who only show up occasionally. Spiritually courageous people
inspire others to be fully present in the life of this congregation, this
religious community. Spiritually courageous people know that the sacred can be
found not only in the woods or in the sunset, but also in the lost job and the
sick child.</span></p>

lang=EN>The spiritual but not religious are welcome here, but they are asked to
become spiritually courageous people who transform the world through justice
and compassion. Here you will find comfort but you may not be comfortable. Here
we will care for you but not take care of you until you are unable to care for
yourself. Here we can acknowledge that Spirit dwells in each of us and when we
join in religious communities sometimes we are challenged by behaviors that
defy this deeply felt truth and beliefs that are different from our own.</span></p>
