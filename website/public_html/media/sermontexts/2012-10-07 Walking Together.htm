<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When I became a Unitarian Universalist almost
fourteen years ago, the new members gathered the night before our Sunday new
member ceremony at the home of our minister. We sat on couches and on chairs
dragged into her living room to accommodate all of us. Some of us even sat on
the floor. There were perhaps fifteen to twenty of us. We were enjoying a
potluck dinner, one of the telling marks of any religious community, when the
minister asked us each to go around the room and briefly say why we had chosen
to join this particular church.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I was about to join a church with more than 1,000
members. I had been attending for less than two years. I knew a small group of
people, mostly parents of the fifth and sixth-graders I had been teaching in
the religious education class each Sunday. It had been only a few years since I
had stopped attending a tiny 25-member Presbyterian Church where sometimes on
Sundays those of us who sang in the choir outnumbered those in the pews. When
it was my time to speak up and answer why I had decided to join the First
Unitarian Church of Dallas, a large corporate-sized church, I said, somewhat to
my surprise, “I am joining for the community. I want to be a member of a
community.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This surprised me and still surprises me when I look
back on this moment in the context of my life as it was then. I had lived in
Dallas for almost twenty years and was a member of many communities: the
theatre community, my daughters’ school communities, my workplace community and
the circle of friends I’d gathered for twenty years that intersected all of
those communities, including my new church community. Perhaps if I’d been more
articulate in my hastily worded response in the casual potluck atmosphere, I
might have better said why I was joining the church. Perhaps I would have said
that I wanted <u>religious</u> community, that I wanted a place where I could
learn to trust myself and others, that in the “Bowling Alone” culture that left
me feeling on my own too much of the time, I wanted  a community that walked
together with mutual purpose. What I didn’t know how to articulate at the time,
but what I now know, is that I wanted a community “united in covenant rather
than by creed” (Peter Morales, “Learning to trust”).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Few people would admit that they have joined a
Unitarian Universalist church because they want a community united in covenant
rather than creed. In the short time that I have been a minister what I have
heard most is that people are attracted to Unitarian Universalism because of
the seven principles. They do also come to our congregations seeking community,
care and connection. Many are surprised to find like-minded people sitting next
to them. We love to tell over and over how many of us have said, “I’ve been a
Unitarian Universalist all of my life but didn’t realize it until a friend
suggested I come and check out their church.” And for many, it is “love at
first sight” with the Seven Principles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What many do not realize is “that the Principles and
Purposes document was crafted and adopted as a unified piece with four distinct
segments: an opening covenant, seven Principles, six Sources, and two
concluding paragraphs that serve as a benediction to the overall text” (<i>Engaging
Our Theological Diversity</i>, p. 126). The Seven Principles and the Six
Purposes are a covenant and by publishing them each week in our order of
service we are implying that we enter into that covenant not with each other,
but with other Unitarian Universalist congregations. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The covenant begins with these words: “We, the
member congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association, covenant to
affirm and promote” and ends with these words: “Grateful for the religious
pluralism which enriches and ennobles our faith, we are inspired to deepen our
understanding and expand our vision. As free congregations we enter into this
covenant, promising to one another our mutual trust and support.” In between
these statements are the seven principles and the six sources. When you
participate in the life of a Unitarian Universalist congregation, even if you
are a first-time visitor, you are entering into this covenant. That is why we
print the words of the principles and sources in our order of service each
Sunday and declare that they are the “backbone of our religious community.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Indeed they are the backbone of our religious
community, but it is the promise, the covenant to affirm and promote the
principles and sources that add muscle to our backbone. Without trust our
muscles are weak; without trust the practice of our religion is without value.
Writing recently, the Reverend Peter Morales, President of our Association,
acknowledges the role of trust in our spiritual lives. “Where trust is weak,
words of a covenant mean little. Yet there is a strong tradition of distrust in
our movement. We were born in rebellion against oppressive religious and civil
authorities who had betrayed trust. We have inherited a strong
antiauthoritarian streak.” (“Learning to trust” <i>UU World</i>, Fall 2012). He
reminds us that trust can be learned and earned. He concludes that, “Trust is
what love looks like when it has matured, when love has deepened, when love
aspires to a common purpose.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Aspiring to a common purpose, many of our
congregations build on the words of the seven principles and six sources to
create congregational covenants. Emulating the democratic process that created
the association’s covenant, autonomous congregations pull from their own past
traditions and experiences and create meaningful covenants that serve as models
for the Beloved Community we hope to create in the wider community. Congregational
covenants also connect us to our Puritan history. “In her study of the history
of covenant in UU tradition, lay theologian and minister Alice Blair
Wesley…shows…how church records in Dedham, Massachusetts, describe in detail
the house meetings the founders held in 1637 to develop the foundation of their
covenant” (<i>Engaging Our Theological Diversity</i>, p. 68). Our covenantal
tradition comes directly from the Pilgrims and other Puritans who founded this
country, pledging to bind themselves to each other, walking together in their
religious lives. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Last June this congregation approved a Covenant of
Good Relations that was formed out of a process that included the leadership of
Arlene Bloom, the partnership with consultant Jim Grant, the participation of
28 members of the congregation in a day-long workshop and the writing efforts
of committee members Candy Gantka, Ellen Smith and Jo Ann Van Reenan. In June
we read the covenant aloud during our annual meeting. This morning we read the
words again to each other, inviting in guests and visitors. Our covenant is a
living document. Without trust our covenant is weak. With trust our covenant
will endure.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the book <i>Theology Ablaze, </i>the book we are
studying together this year in worship and religious education, Tom Owen-Towle
has this to say about covenant: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>I’ve
grown to think of Unitarian Universalism as the invitation to “pledge our
troth” (a striking, traditional phrase that weds both <i>truthfulness</i> and <i>trust)
</i>to one another, as we forge our religious paths alone…together.
Truthfulness means we’ll intentionally spread no falsehoods. And trust suggests
we’ll commit no deliberate harm (p. 46).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.5in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Wedding both truthfulness and trust, we take a vow
when we enter into our congregational covenant. I take that same vow with you. In
addition, my ministry agreement contains covenantal language in the statement:
“It is recognized that no matter how carefully this Agreement is written and
observed, the relationship between the Congregation and the Minister must be
grounded in open communication, mutual trust, good faith, and open and fair
process on both sides.”</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Last year you installed me as your minister, not
with ancient words from a tradition written in stone, but with a covenant
crafted out of our unique relationship. In the Unitarian Universalist tradition
of religious freedom, the authority and privilege of calling a minister rests
solely and completely with the members of the local congregation. Likewise, a
Unitarian Universalist minister freely chooses how to respond to that call.
Minster and congregation enter a sacred covenant, a committed promise to be in
relationship in a particular way. In this past year you have welcomed me into
your community of connection and care, inviting me to live and speak the truth
in love as best as I am able. In the covenant we declared last year you pledged
your respect, hope, faith and love. With humility, I answered your call and
pledged my respect, hope, faith, and love in return. I know well that we are
all human. That is why I pledged to honor that humanity with patience, love,
and charity toward each of you, and yes, also towards myself as your minister. We
made a promise to each other, we “pledged our troth,” and entered into a
covenant written from our hearts and spoken consciously with conviction. When I
joined the First Unitarian Church of Dallas fourteen years ago seeking
community, I never dreamed that covenantal community would give me the gift of
ministry and that walking together would lead me here.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The story “Feathers,” from the Jewish tradition is a
story about living in community, breaking promises and doing the hard work of
learning to trust. The story is widely told in the story-telling community
mostly as a morality tale to illustrate the damage that gossiping can do. I
think it is also a reminder of how to live in a covenantal community. The
purpose of a covenant is not to punish or to point out when people are wrong.
The purpose of a covenant is to bind us to a way of being that we can be called
to or called back to when we transgress.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In the story a man with a habit of gossiping hurts
another’s reputation with his harmful words. Offering a shallow apology, the
man promises to take back his words assuming all will be well. “But you can’t
take back your words,” protests the victim. The wise rabbi of the small village
instructs the gossip to return to the village square the next day with his
feather pillow. The man agrees to this, wondering how the loss of a feather
pillow can provide justice for the slip of a tongue. In the end the gossip
learns his lesson. After following the rabbi’s instructions and releasing all
of the feathers from his pillow, he understands how impossible it would be for
him to take back all the harmful words he has spread as rumors. Just as the
feathers were carried on the wind beyond the walls of the village square, his
words had carried their damage far and wide. It is said that the man apologized
sincerely to his victim and never spoke harmful words again. It may have been
impossible for him to clean up the mess of the feathers, but he could do his
best to clean up the mess he had made of his relationship with his fellow
village dwellers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>In my fourteen years dwelling in the village of
Unitarian Universalism I have seen a lot of feathers flying near and far. When
I became a Unitarian Universalist almost fourteen years ago, the close friend
who had invited me to the church was no longer speaking to me. Eventually we reconciled,
listening intently to each other’s pain. The feathers that we tossed to the
wind were more easily retrieved in the promise of forgiving community.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Another time I found out that a member of my
covenant group had broken confidentiality and had spoken cruelly about me to
someone outside the church. This situation was made more complicated by the
fact that he had already left the church. I could not speak directly to him
because he was no longer a member of the church community. Yet, the covenant
had been broken. Feathers were flying. I found that I needed to forgive both
myself and him, cleaning up the mess in the private recesses of my own heart. Church
life has offered up other broken promises and each and every time I am called
to gather up the far-flung feathers of the pain, clean up the messes I have
made and come back to the covenant, the mutual promise we make to each other as
a people of faith. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Trust is not built by avoiding pain and conflict,
trust is built when we call ourselves back to the promise and begin again in
love. “Learning to earn one another’s trust and to empower one another is
ultimately a spiritual practice,” Peter Morales tells us. Each time a new
person enters this community our covenant is strengthened when we learn and
earn trust. Each time we read the seven principles and reflect on the six
sources we can be reminded how, as free congregations, we enter into a
covenant, promising to one another our mutual trust and support. We can read
our own congregational covenant to open committee meetings, at board meetings
and at congregational meetings, reminding ourselves of our intention to foster
healthy and productive relations within our church community as we work together
to nurture spiritually courageous people who transform the world through
justice and compassion. Pledging to walk together, inviting all who enter into
the circle of trust, into our covenantal community.</p>
