<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We often sing, “Come, come, whoever you are, wanderer,
worshiper, lover of leaving. Ours is no caravan of despair. Come, yet again
come.” As Unitarian Universalists we sing these words as an offering of radical
hospitality. We sing these words because we know what it is to wander among
beliefs, building our own theologies from remnants of personal experience and the
wisdom of the ages. We sing these words because many of us have left churches,
temples and religions that no longer make sense to us. And we sing these words
lighting the candle of hope against the darkness of despair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The words we sing are supposedly adapted from the Persian
poet and mystic Rumi. The original words, in one translation are:</span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>&quot;Come again, please, come again,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Whoever you are.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Religious, infidel, heretic or pagan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Even if you promised a hundred times</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Come, come as you are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='color:black'>The
adapted words we sing welcome the religious seeker into a community committed
to radical hospitality, called “transformative spiritual hospitality” by
Presbyterian Minister Nanette Sawyer. The original words of Rumi’s poem imply
that all are welcome to repentance; all are welcome to return to right living. It
is interesting to note that Rumi may not be the author who originally suggested
that all are welcome to repent and return. Even if the original words belong to
an earlier, Turkish writer, the message contained in them is clear: all are
welcome and perhaps, more importantly, all are welcome to return again and
again to our caravan of seekers, searchers, and lovers of life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>When you visit our congregation we offer you a red cup, a
green nametag and promise these tools will help us identify you as a visitor.
You enter into this mysterious system that, if you want it to, will move you
from visitor to new friend, to friend and onto the ultimate goal, for “us”
anyway, of member status. Along the way we stick a colored dot on your nametag,
change the color of your nametag, and if a friend brought you with them for a
visit, slap a “halleluujah” (yes, with two “U”s) sticker on their nametag. All
through this process you might stand innocently in the corner of Fellowship
Hall with your red cup feeling like Pastor Nanette Sawyer upon her first visit
to a meditation center. “I stood there awkwardly,” she writes, “feeling a bit
miffed that no one was speaking to me. Didn’t they realize that I was a
newcomer? Couldn’t they see that I was feeling shy? Why wasn’t anyone welcoming
me?” (<i>Hospitality – the Sacred Art</i>) Like Pastor Sawyer, you may be
asking yourself, “Why aren’t these people aware of my vulnerabilities?” clutching
your red cup anxiously. The transforming moment came for Pastor Sawyer when she
noticed that “they,” those she had labeled as the confident, belonging, inside
circle ones were just as vulnerable as she, the uncomfortable, new, outsider
one. The transforming moment came when she realized her own power to be
hospitable in any situation. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The greeters, the membership committee and the board all
just breathed a collective sigh of relief. We’re not responsible for making
visitors feel comfortable – they are, many are now thinking. Thank the g-word
that many of us would refrain from using because we want to make sure that
everyone feels welcome here, infidel, pagan and heretic alike. “They,”
according to Pastor Sawyer, can just reach deeply inside themselves and bring
out the receptivity, reverence, and generosity that they have to offer. We can
just keep talking to the people we know. Whew!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The promise of the church of the radical welcome is that we
will meet you in that vulnerable space between us. We will meet you in that
space where the “I” begins to dissolve and the “we” begins to take shape. We
see you in our own vulnerability and understand that welcoming the stranger is
an invitation to welcome the stranger in our own souls. It is comforting to
learn that you carry your own capability for radical hospitality, defined by
receptivity, reverence and generosity. We carry this capability as well. And we
need you to show up in order to discover our own capability. We need you to
meet us in that space between us where we can hold your vulnerability along
with our own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In her TED talk on the power of vulnerability, researcher
and storyteller Brené Brown talks about how we numb ourselves to vulnerability.
She talks about how in numbing our vulnerability, we numb all of our emotions
because it is impossible to select which terrifying emotion we want to numb
when we reach for those three beers or that banana nut muffin. Dr. Brown has a
PhD in social work. She would rather be gathering data, measuring it and fixing
the world’s problems than admitting to her own vulnerability. In the end this
is what she has discovered: “to let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably
seen; to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee…just to
be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen, to say, ‘I'm
just so grateful, because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive.’”(<a

</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The church of the radical welcome is a place where we take
responsibility for our own reaction to vulnerability. Think about that the next
time you see a visitor wearing their green nametag, standing by themselves in
Fellowship Hall holding a red cup. You can acknowledge your own terror at
meeting someone new, thinking “I’m just so grateful, because to feel this
vulnerable means I’m alive.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>“Come, yet again come.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>When I went back to church after a fifteen-year absence, I
went to sing in the choir. A friend had invited me to her small Presbyterian
Church whose theology was liberal enough for me: they had participated in the
Sanctuary Movement of the 1980s, housing refugees from El Salvador. They were a
“More Light Church,” the Presbyterian equivalent of our Welcoming Congregation
designation, a congregation dedicated to LGBT rights at the beginning of the
AIDS epidemic. I wasn’t there for the theology. I was there to sing. My first
visit to the church was not for worship; it was for a choir rehearsal. I sat in
the car for what seemed like hours, feeling terrified. Hoping I was at the
right place. Waiting for my friend to show up. There were only a handful of
cars in the parking lot. I must have been the last to arrive. Finally I
summoned the courage and somehow found the right door leading into the choir loft.
My friend was there, along with six strangers. It was a small choir. I was the
second soprano – not A second soprano as opposed to a first soprano. I was THE
second soprano. There were two sopranos, two of us, sometimes three if the
altos could spare an extra voice. I had not sung in a choir since high school.
Sharing my voice with six strangers was excruciating.  It was a vulnerability I
was willing to bear. It was a shared vulnerability that allowed me to connect
to strangers who changed my life: one who is now dead from AIDS, another who is
my daughter’s godmother, one who is now suffering from breast cancer, another
who continues to share her recovery from alcoholism with me, others who are
still in my life despite the many miles that now separate us.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>When I left the church, about three years later, the
minister tried to convince me to stay. I was going through a divorce and I felt
that the church did a better job at responding to our members who were dying
from AIDS than it was doing responding to my struggles as a newly-divorced
single parent looking for full-time work. She advised me that I should wait,
that I shouldn’t make the decision during such a major life transition. Looking
back I know that I was blaming the church for being uncomfortable with my pain.
I failed to step outside myself into the space where I could hold my
vulnerability along with theirs. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>The risk we take when we hand someone the red cup, telling
them “Come, come whoever you are,” is that they will not come back. In the
church of the radical welcome we are willing to take that risk, knowing that
the need for connection is fundamental to the life fully lived.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Pastor Nanette Sawyer writes that “transformative spiritual
hospitality,” what some call radical hospitality, “flows from <i>receptivity</i>,
<i>reverence</i>, and <i>generosity</i> – three qualities that reflect a basic
pattern of movement: in-with-out.” We practice radical hospitality in
ever-widening circles – with ourselves, our families, our communities and the
world. Receptivity is the inner state we develop when we affirm that we are
enough, we do not have to be perfect to deserve love, we can be open to receive
the gifts that are available to us now. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Frances Pardee, our pledge co-chair, shares the old joke
that UUs, even though they’re one of the wealthiest denominations, give the
least because they’re not afraid of going to hell. Most of us are not motivated
to generosity in order to be rewarded with heaven. Most of us, like Frances,
are motivated by contributing to causes that make heaven on earth now. Giving
at the level of the modern tithe, as Frances says, is radical generosity. If we
follow the model of radical hospitality to ourselves and others, then
receptivity comes first. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>We can be the recipients of our own generosity. As members
of this community, practicing radical hospitality, we receive the gifts of this
congregation, sit in reverence with each other and give generously to the
institution that holds us in our vulnerability. We affirm that we are enough.
We affirm that this community is enough, even when people drink from the red
cup and then move on, we know we have done nothing wrong. There is no one to
blame, no faults to be fixed. We are good enough. We receive the love here for
us. We are worthy of a permanent church home with enough room for our religious
education classes. We are worthy of state-of-the art facilities that attract
the paradigm-shifting conversations produced by our Community Forum. This
church deserves high quality, transformative worship experiences. You deserve
all of this and so do our visitors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>Wednesday night we moved the New UU class from the board
room to the sanctuary because there were too many people to fit around the
conference table. Meditation class was being held in the adult religious
education classroom and the adult religious education class, “Dangerous Words,”
was being held in Fellowship Hall. I love the energy of this church when it is
filled with the sounds of people becoming spiritually courageous. At the end of
the New UU class, I invited those who were interested to sign the book.  Someone
joked that this meant he no longer had access to the red cup. No longer the
uncomfortable, new, outsider he could now become the confident, belonging,
insider. He was joking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In the church of the radical welcome we practice a
reverence for all of life. We share an intimacy with you that is not based on
knowing your name, your occupation or your place of birth. Intimacy does not
need time to develop from the comfort of getting to know you. True intimacy
comes when we see our own vulnerability in your eyes. We promise to meet you in
that space where the “I” begins to dissolve and the “we” begins to take shape.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='color:black'>In the church of the radical welcome our generosity
naturally flows out of the depths of our being to offer physical, emotional,
and spiritual care. Radical generosity comes from first dollars, not leftover
dollars. Radical hospitality flows from receptivity, reverence, and generosity.
On the in-breath we receive all that life has to offer. On the out-breath we
give generously of ourselves. In that pause before the next breath we stand
together trusting in our shared vulnerability, meeting in the space where the
“I” begins to dissolve and the “we” begins to take shape.</span></p>
