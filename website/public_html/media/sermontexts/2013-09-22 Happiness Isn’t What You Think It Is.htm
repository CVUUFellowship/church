at the Conejo Valley Unitarian Universalist Fellowship<br>

<p>I’ve been a Unitarian Universalist for over 20 years. I’ve always especially
enjoyed the encouragement from the Unitarian church to explore all the
spiritual options, to question, learn, and not to be constrained by convention.
Our fourth principle says get out there and look at all the ways the world
thinks about the momentous and the divine. Well, it doesn’t say that exactly.
It says, “We affirm and promote a free and responsible search for truth and
meaning.” Same thing. Almost.</p>

<p>Thanks to the fourth principle, several years ago I decided to visit a
Buddhist meditation center. I had been wanting to learn how to meditate and I
kept trying it on my own. And I kept getting nowhere. It’s not an easy thing to
figure out on your own. I read books, set aside time, removed distractions, sat
down alone and tried clearing my mind. That’s one of the first steps, just
clear your mind. Ever tried doing that? Our minds are wild with thoughts all
the time. Clearing your mind is like mopping the floor of your leaky basement
in a flood. You push away some water, and more rushes in. You push away some
thoughts and more of them rush in.</p>

<p>After a while, I decided I was not going to figure out how to meditate on my
own. So I did what most of us would do if we were looking for help learning to
meditate: I Googled “meditation” and then “guided meditation” where I came upon
an entry for a Buddhist meditation center with weekly classes, everyone
welcome, all levels of experience, come on down. So I went.</p>

<p>That was three years ago, and I’ve been attending Kadampa Buddhist classes
since then. They are guided meditation sessions interspersed with Buddha’s
teachings, which are called The Dharma. In his lifetime, Buddha Shakyamuni gave
84,000 teachings altogether, a body of work which—if nothing else—makes you
appreciate the term “Buddhist scholar”! Imagine mastering 84,000 teachings! I’m
not planning to do that in this lifetime. I got off to a late start.</p>

<p>But I have learned from several things from these teachings that, frankly,
have rocked my world.</p>

<p>One of them is that happiness isn’t what I think it is. That I, in fact,
have no idea how to be happy. Most of us don’t. Which is why so many people are
so unhappy much of the time. Ever noticed that? You ask someone “How are you?”
and they don’t say “I’m really happy, just like I am all the time!” More often
you hear, “I’m okay. You?” Or “Same old, same old.” Or you say “How are you?”
and they say “Don’t ask!” A far cry from “I am happy, thank you.”</p>

<p>What I’ve always thought happiness was, that is so not it. I always thought
happiness was a moment of pleasure, could be a short moment or a long one.
Happiness is driving that new car off the lot or winning a prize or landing
that new job, taking up with a new love, or maybe just reading a great book,
and so by definition happiness was a fleeting state. We like that, the new car,
the prize, the great book, it sure is nice, too bad it never lasts. I assumed
happiness came from things and situations, something as small as taking a bite
of my favorite ice cream or as big as a two-week vacation in Tahiti.</p>

<p>But when they come to an end, there goes happiness. We wait for the next
vacation, the next new car, the next bowl of ice cream. Or, the things that
made us happy turn on us: we get tired of the new car, it gets old and breaks
down and we can’t wait to get rid of it. We’re sick of the job we were so
excited to land. Or we’re disappointed by the ice cream because the first bite
was great, but the last one was one too many and we don’t feel well.</p>

<p>What Buddha teaches about happiness is that isn’t a series of fleeting
moments we create and string together and then try to hang on to. Instead,
happiness is a persistent state of being that all of us have the ability to get
to, and it isn’t found in day-to-day life.</p>

<p>There’s a Sanskrit word for day-to-day life that comes up a lot in our
classes at the Kadampa Buddhist center. Many of you probably know this word.
The word is samsara, day-to-day existence, the difficulties, the mundane, the
search for pleasure in the stuff around us. That’s samsara and it is where we
are most of the time. In samsara, we are knocking off our “to do” list, we’re
striving, being disappointed. In samsara, we are physically uncomfortable,
we’re anxious, busy, stressed, wishing for relief.</p>

<p>Most of us are looking for happiness in our everyday existence, in samsara.
But it isn’t there. If samsara isn’t where we find happiness, then where is it?</p>

<p>A Buddhist monk named Mathieu Ricard, who was once a renowned molecular
biologist in France, says happiness is a deep sense of peace and fulfillment, a
persistent state of being that underlies all emotional states, all joys and all
sorrows. That’s how he describes happiness, and he should know. He’s been named
“the happiest man in the world” by scientists who have been researching brain
function. You see, if you want to find out how happy someone is, you measure
the strength and activity of his or her brain’s left prefrontal cortex. That’s
where happiness activity occurs in the brain. Researchers in Berkeley and in
Madison, Wisconsin who measure prefrontal cortex activity announced a few years
ago that they’d used this method to measure happiness in a variety of people
and they then proclaimed Mathieu Ricard “the happiest man in the world” because
his left prefrontal cortex readings are off the charts.</p>

<p>How does he achieve this? By meditating on compassion. When they’re
measuring his brain function, that’s what he’s doing. Meditating on compassion.</p>

<p>And it wasn’t just Mathieu Ricard whose brain function was measured.
Researchers conducted these studies with hundreds of master meditators, all of
them Buddhist monks. Into each monk’s skull, the researchers plugged in 256
electrodes. Then the monks meditated on compassion. The results are consistent.
If we had a projector, I’d show you a graphic. So let’s pretend we do. This is
virtual Powerpoint. The graph I’ve seen of these results starts with a bell
curve showing the distribution of activity across the left and right prefrontal
cortexes in normal ordinary people. And, since I said it’s a bell curve, you
can imagine it looks like a bell, with about half of ordinary people
experiencing some happy feelings and half some sad feelings, with a peak in the
middle where most people are, the average hohum state of mind. When the monks
meditating on happiness were measured, they were over here (point to indicate
way over to the left, far outside bell). Way over here.</p>

<p>Buddha says compassion—focusing on the plights of others—is the key to
happiness. So why does that work? Well, on one level it seems obvious. If you
want to be unhappy, focus on your own plights—on whatever is going wrong in
your life, on the job you didn’t get, on how disappointed you are in your
spouse, your children, your boss, or whoever you’re disappointed in. That’s
guaranteed to bring you down.</p>

<p>But there’s more to it than just that.</p>

<p>What’s the opposite of happiness? Remember happiness is a persistent state
of being, a deep sense of peace and fulfillment. It’s not momentary pleasure. So
the opposite of happiness? Anger, desire, frustration, impatience. To name a
few. And every one of them is focused on ME. All about me. Anger: I’m angry
when things don’t go as I want. Desire: I want a better neighborhood, a shorter
commute, a bigger paycheck. I want to be liked, I want to be successful.
Impatience: I can’t stand when things bog down, take too long, are
misunderstood. I can’t stand it. All of it the opposite of happiness. And all
of it aimed directly at myself.</p>

<p>Instead, re-direct your mental focus to the plight of others. That’s
compassion. Buddha says compassion is a mind, a state of mind, that is
motivated by valuing other living beings and wishing them well, wishing them to
be free from distress, pain, and other forms of suffering. Turn your attention
away from the things that can bring you down—anger, frustration, etc.,—and turn
it <em>to</em> others. That makes compassion an antidote for unhappiness.</p>

<p>Buddha also says that we are naturally compassionate beings. One bi of
evidence for this is the phenomenon in our brains called mirror neurons.
They’re neurons that fire when we observe actions performed by someone else,
that mirror those actions. It is, for example, why we smile when someone smiles
at us. It’s also why we reflect a compassionate expression back to someone who
shares a story of personal difficulty with us. It reflects our inner response.</p>

<p>That’s the good news. We’re naturally compassionate beings. The trouble is
we don’t spend enough time there. We spend far more time being frustrated,
angry, and impatient. But if we spent more time on compassion, we’d be happier,
genuinely happier.</p>

<p>So let’s say you’re persuaded that developing your natural compassionate
tendencies and using your compassion in everyday life will, in fact, make you
happier. Okay, then, how do you do that?</p>

<p>We have to prepare our minds to be more compassionate—spontaneously and all
the time. Compassion is a state of mind and, though we have within us the seeds
of compassion, we need to grow those seeds. A coordinated young person who’s
good at doing cartwheels in the back yard doesn’t become a gymnast without
training. We can look at this the same way. We train our minds to become more
compassionate, to develop and strengthen our natural ability.</p>

<p>This is where meditation and mindfulness practices come in. That’s how we
train. So I thought I’d share with you a couple of practices you can engage in
as often as you like that will help you train in compassion and happiness.</p>

<p>Again, this is one of Buddha’s teachings that really hit me over the head.
First of all, it’s a teaching which I find especially close to Unitarian
Universalist values. And it is this: everyone else is just like me. I’m no
different from you, and you’re no different from the person sitting next to you
because we all want the same things. We want to be happy. We don’t want to
suffer. In UU terms, every human has worth and dignity. Strangers aren’t just
strangers, they’re human beings and we should see them as that, people who
matter.</p>

<p>But there’s one more thing in Buddha’s teaching about how we view others as
like ourselves, and this is the part that surprised me. Not only is everyone
else just like me, but everyone else is just as important as I am. What
everyone else wants is just as important as what I want.</p>

<p>That’s not, of course, how we usually see things. We usually see what I want
as the most important and what you want is either not important or not very
important to me. What I care about is most important. Example: If I don’t get that
promotion at work I’ve been hoping for, I’m hugely disappointed. I may go
through a whole box of Kleenex before I start to get over it. But if you don’t
get the promotion you’ve been hoping for, I’m not reaching for the Kleenex. I
may say, “Wow, that’s too bad,” but I’m not really strung out over it.</p>

<p>Another example: If I have a headache, I gotta get rid of it now! My world
stops because this headache has taken over! Get me the Motrin! If you have a
headache, I don’t really care. I may offer you a Motrin, but your headache
isn’t nearly as important to me as mine is.</p>

<p>One more: If my life doesn’t turn out the way I want it to, if I don’t reach
my goals and aspirations, I may be very depressed about that. If your life
doesn’t turn out the way you want it to, I’m not depressed about that.</p>

<p>Yet when you consider there are countless beings in the world, all of them
concerned about something, all of them wanting something, and they too thinking
that what they want matters most … countless beings … then what I want among
billions can’t possibly be as important as I think it is.</p>

<p>So the practice is seeing what everyone else wants as just as important as
what I want. Seeing things this way elevates the concerns and desires of others
into our view. What they want matters, matters a lot. We value them. It’s much
easier to be compassionate about people whom we see as important.</p>

<p>The Buddhists call this “equalizing self and others.” In our UU principle we
say “equity.” Principle #2, “We affirm and promote justice, equity and
compassion in human relations.” We promote equity. We believe the happiness and
suffering of others are important.</p>

<p>So that’s one practice, seeing others as important.</p>

<p>Once you’ve done that, the next practice is easy: use your imagination to
wish them well. You see someone in the parking lot, in an elevator, in the
grocery store, and you know that they’re dealing with some difficulty. They’re
in samsara, remember, which is by definition a place of many struggles. You
know they’re suffering in some way. So wish them well. Wish them the strength,
the peace of mind to get through it. Wish them happiness.</p>

<p>You don’t have to tell them you’re doing that. Hey! I’m wishing you
happiness! Can you feel it? Just do it. In fact, let’s try it right now. Pick
someone in this room—someone you know well, or someone you don’t know at all.
Close your eyes, take a few breaths, and then bring that person to mind. Even
if you don’t know what they’re struggling with, focus on them, and send them
good wishes. Wish them love, peace, confidence. It’s something you can do any
time. And you’ll find it has the most remarkable effect. It changes not only
how you experience the world but how others experience you.</p>

<p>One last thought: you could set aside ten minutes a day to wish others well.
Ten minutes away from technology, confusion, and intrusions. Simply think about
the welfare of someone else. Wish them well.</p>

<p>What if everyone in greater Los Angeles did that, all 11 million of us, set
aside ten minutes every morning just to wish others well? Think life here would
be different?</p>

<p>Even if we want to lead a compassionate life, if we’re persuaded it’s good
for others and it’s good for me, still it’s not an easy transition. Takes time
to turn around an ocean liner and get it going the other way. Which is why I
like the simple, tactical approach Buddha recommends. Take time out every day
to reflect and meditate. See others as important, and wish them
well—constantly. It’s incredibly easy to do, and much more fun than I imagined
it would be.</p>

<p>I wish you all well. I wish you happiness, inner peace, and much love.</p>
