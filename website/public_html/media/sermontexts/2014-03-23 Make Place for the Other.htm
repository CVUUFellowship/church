Rev. Lora Brandis</b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Salvador
de Jesús Cardenal Barquero, the composer of “Busca el Amor,” was one of the
most well-known songwriters in Nicaragua and Central America. He was also a
poet, painter and ecologist. When he was 17 he started playing the guitar he
got as a present during his years studying to be a Jesuit priest in Panamá. He
left the monastery before becoming a priest and went back to Nicaragua during
their revolution to pursue a career in folk music. Salvador Cardenal died at
the age of 49 from a rare blood disease. His 1999 song “Busca el Amor” is
included in our teal hymnal, along with a translation. We sing his original
words in Spanish, looking at the English translation, knowing that a
translation can never be exact. Singing in a language many of us do not know,
we practice the science of compassion, entering in an empathetic way into
another culture. We broaden our perspective so that we can make place for the
other. <b>Sing refrain: “Busca el amor en ti. Se multiplica si lo repartís.
Busca el amor en ti. Sólo él que ama puede ser feliz.” </b></p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>A
translation can never be exact. We acknowledge this when we say something is
“lost in translation.” In order to translate the words to a song or a poem, the
translator themselves must be a poet or a songwriter. Maintaining a certain
rhythm, making the words fit the meter or the music that is already there, the
translator enters the world of the song or the poem, leaving their own world
behind in service of the original work. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Here
is Ted Warmbrand’s translation of Barquero’s refrain: “Seek out the love in
you, and find the joy that comes to those who care. Seek out the love in you.
It only grows whenever it is shared. Seek out the love in you. And find the joy
that comes to those who care.” An exact translation is: “Seek out the love in
you; it multiplies if you share it. Seek out the love in you, only one who
loves can be happy.” </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>The
translation of the refrain is close. The verse is more problematic. The verse
is more poetic with words like “the love on your high shelf” and “your heart’s
a chameleon” and “el amor lo que hace al otro bien.” The translator chooses to
translate “el otro” – the other – as “someone else.” The “other” usually means
more than simply “someone else” and so its original meaning in the song may get
somewhat lost in translation. “Other” is a label we use to mean “not me,” “not
us.” Other is a label we use to keep ourselves separate, to hold ourselves
apart.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In
her work as a religious historian, Karen Armstrong was struck by a footnote in
a book referring to the “science of compassion.” The writer of the footnote
urged the religious historian to enter into the world of the religious past in
a scholarly and empathetic way. “A religious historian must not ‘substitute his
own or his readers’ conventions for the original,’ the author explained;
rather, he should ‘broaden his perspective so that it can make place for the
other’” (TSTACL, page 117). As this attitude became a daily practice for
Armstrong, she began to notice how seldom we “make place for the other” in even
the simplest of our day-to-day social interactions.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>More
often than not we impose our own experiences and beliefs upon others. We interpret
reality through a lens that has been polished by our own set of life
experiences. Because we do this, we often make harmful judgments about others.
To “make place for the other” is to empty ourselves of preconceived notions and
assumptions and, with empathy, enter into the lives of those we would label as
the “other” as if their life was our own.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Preacher
and poet Ted Loder asks his god to empty him. “Empty me of the ways I
unthinkingly think of myself as powerless, as a victim, as determined by sex,
age, race, as being less than I am, or as other than yours,” he writes. “Empty
me of the disguises and lies in which I hide myself from other people and from
my responsibility for my neighbors and for the world,” he prays.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Last
Friday three of us from this congregation traveled to Tijuana with a UU Border
Justice trip to learn more about the situation there. We have all visited with immigrant
detainees at the Adelanto Detention Center in Victorville, California, and we
wanted to see what happens when someone is deported to Mexico. Hesitant that we
would be merely tourists of poverty, hesitant to leave our comfort and our
privilege behind, we hoped we could empty ourselves of our preconceptions and
enter into the lives of those who have been labeled “other” by a broken
immigration system and by the brokenness of the human condition. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>In
four days we visited the drop off point for deportees, two shelters, a group
that fights for factory workers’ rights, members of a colonia cooperative, and
an orphanage housed in an old hotel overlooking the ocean. We also volunteered
in the garden at the border fence and helped to serve 1300 meals Monday morning
before departing for home.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It
isn’t always necessary to cross a border to encounter the “other.” This is the
premise of a book written by Harold Recinos, one of my professor’s from
seminary. Wary of North American Christians who have made a practice of
creating service trips to Third World countries, he is concerned that the poor
of the First World will be overlooked in our own inner cities. Growing up in
the South Bronx, a Puerto Rican first-generation Latino, with the label of
Nuyorican, Recinos and his brother became junkies on the streets as teenagers. </p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Dr.
Recinos encountered his god on the streets and at the margins. “I first learned
about the Christian faith,” he writes, “in the tears shed on lonely nights in
barrio tenements, and in the person of a white Presbyterian minister and his
family who nurtured me back to life from junkiedom…. Christ was in my poverty leading
me to become a minister devoted to understanding how the poor and oppressed
interpret what is ultimate for Christianity,” he also writes. (<i>Jesus Weeps</i>,
p. 33). For many Unitarian Universalists listening to his story is a journey
into the life of the religious “other.” Make place for the other, we ask of
ourselves. “Empty me now of gnawing dissatisfactions, of anxious imaginings, of
fretful preoccupations, of nagging prejudices, of old scores to settle, and of
the arrogance of being right,” the poet prays.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It
was in Professor Recinos’ class that I first learned about the politics of
contradiction that have guided the United States border policies: capital,
goods, commodities, services and information can freely cross our borders, but
people seeking employment, especially those fleeing poverty, cannot. Border
enforcement tightened specifically in 1994, the same time the North American
Free Trade Agreement was put in place, and again after 9/11. In 1994, during
the first part of the Clinton administration, “Operation Gatekeeper” slowed
migratory traffic at the busiest two places on the border. The concentration of
border enforcement in San Diego and El Paso meant that migrants started taking
new crossing points including more dangerous parts of the Rio Grande and more
isolated areas. More dangerous crossings translate to more deaths.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>It
was in Professor Recinos’ class that I also first learned about a woman named
Elvira Arellano. Arellano attracted national attention and was named a person
of the year by <i>Time</i> magazine for staying in the cramped storefront
Adalberto United Methodist Church in Chicago for one year, invoking the
traditional protection of sanctuary. Arellano lived at the church with her
eight-year-old son until she was arrested and deported after trying to speak
out publicly on behalf of other immigrants. Arellano’s year of living in the
safe refuge of Adalberto UMC was the beginning of the New Sanctuary Movement.
Members of this congregation participated in the movement here when they
accompanied a woman named Liliana who lived at the UCC parsonage in Simi Valley
for several years.</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'><br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>This
past Tuesday Elvira Arellano re-entered the United States. She led a group of
dozens of mostly young undocumented immigrant deportees in crossing back into
the United States, while protesting the plight of immigrants deported to a
sometimes violent country where they feel like strangers. Last Sunday Elvira
was in Tijuana encouraging another group of undocumented deportees before their
act of civil disobedience in crossing the border and we met her. Our group from
the UU Justice Ministries border trip was there, wearing our yellow t-shirts
and supporting those who were about to cross. We met Elvira and other brave
souls, including some LGBTQ activists who would rather risk time in detention than
risk their lives one more day in a place that condemns how they love. We walked
through the group lining up to cross. Maria gave balloons to children crossing
with their mothers, distracting and comforting them. We sang. We listened to
their stories. And before we left to participate in a worship service at the
border wall, I was asked to give a blessing to the group, which was translated
by Hugo, a representative of the Border Angels.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>I
was translated again at the binational worship service that takes place every
Sunday on both sides of the border. Separated by two walls, three ministers
gather each Sunday to lead worship at what they call La Iglesia del Faro, the
Border Church. I had prepared a short homily the night before, knowing that
Rev. John Fanestil, a Methodist minister standing on the US side would
translate. I would speak English on the Mexican side of the border and he would
speak Spanish on the US side. I had written some opening remarks in my homily
that included a brief explanation of Unitarian Universalism. After all, this
would be the first time that a UU minister had participated in the Border
Church worship service; I felt an explanation was needed. “As a Unitarian
Universalist minister I am called to affirm the worth and dignity of every
person,” I had written.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Peering
at Rev. John through the two walls, not really able to see his entire face, I
introduced myself. I met Father Guillermo, the Methodist minister on the
Mexican side standing with me who I would help to serve communion on that side
of the border. I then met the Catholic priest who helps serve communion on the
US side. Again, speaking through two layers of fence, our meeting obscured by
the metal mesh of the border wall erected after the 2006 Secure Fence Act, the
priest met me joyfully, saying, “We throw out our denominational affiliations
at the Border Church, at La Iglesia del Faro.” And in that moment I threw out
my opening remarks setting myself apart as the religious other. Instead I said,
“We are all called to affirm the worth and dignity of every person. We are all
called to stand on the side of love.” The Christian pastors and the Catholic
priest made a place for me, a female Unitarian Universalist minister. The four
of us served communion together, separated by a border constructed by human
hands, knowing that the only walls that separate us from each other are walls
of our own making.</p>

<p style='margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>You
do not have to cross the border to encounter the “other.” Stay here and empty
yourself “of nagging prejudices, of old scores to settle, and of the arrogance
of being right.” Stay here and volunteer to feed the homeless, to write to
prisoners in solitary, to visit with Mixteco children once a month. Stay here
and care for the elderly, the sick, the “other” that stands on the opposite
side of a border you have made with your own mind. Stay here or cross borders,
understand that translation is not an exact science. We can never completely
understand each other, but we can empty ourselves of what we think we know,
broaden our perspectives and make place for the other. <b>Sing refrain again.</b></p>
