<p><b>COVENANT
MOMENT</b> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>We need a volunteer to take over the
covenant moment for the remainder of the year</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>RE
FORMS</b> - Justine </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Presentation of the research our DRE
has done on forms and pre-screening candidates for RE.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The current practice has been to use
Megan's Law website to check volunteers, a free service. There is a Justice
Department service we are eligible to use which has screening for
non-profits.  Fees are about $75 per
person using private screening services. A discussion regarding the issue
continued.  Policy needs to be written
around several aspects of the issue.  Our
forms cover the same information as UUA and DOJ require.  A request for policy direction from the RE
committee is requested.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Having discussed the RE forms, a vote on
the previously made motions to adopt the forms was taken and all forms were
approved unanimously.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>MINISTERIAL
SEARCH COMMITTEE</b>

<p> </p>

<p>Update on the MSC and highlights from
the congregational survey</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Todd reported the minister agreement
has been the focus of activity and have a draft agreement.  The Board will review the draft agreement in
the next days.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Willie reported 173 respondents to the
survey, 152 identifying themselves as members. 
A few preliminary result items of interest were distributed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>PLEDGE
COMMITTEE</b> - Jeff Goldstein
&amp; David Barker </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Jeff &amp; David will update the board
on the move to year-round pledging.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Jeff presented an overview of the
plan.  The sense of the Board is that the
plan has many advantages over our previous single canvass.  A question was raised regarding the wording
in our bylaws regarding "annual canvass" response, and it was noted that
canvass is still annual but with different months among the membership.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>NEW
SIGNATORIES LIST</b>
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The bank needs a board adopted
signatories list to remove Laura McLean and add Paul Chavez</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Account signers for the bank account are proposed
to be President Claudia Barton, Vice-President Paul Chavez, Treasurer Todd
Hess, and Secretary Michael Talvola.  Two
signatures are required.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Ellen moved to adopt the wording, Carol
seconded.  Motion approved unanimously.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>FINANCE
REPORT</b> -Todd Hess</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Review of our current financial status
and upcoming CVUUF auction.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Todd presented his comments regarding
the financials.  There is a discrepancy
of pledge income in accounting vs pledge information which will be resolved
very soon.  It is believed to be an
accounting only issue, not an actual shortfall of receipts.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The finance committee recommends that
the administrator have priority as pledge secretary, then assume responsibility
for cash handling and other items from a prepared list of tasks.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Changing accounting software to an
internal system from the current system done as a service outside of CVUUF will
be the result of an evaluation process.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Todd presented no additional auction
information.</p>
