<br><br>
A theme of spiritual depth and discovery is chosen each year. The Religious Education Program and Sunday Worship coincide, to ensure the entire congregation explores the same themes each Sunday. Children begin their Sunday morning in worship in our sanctuary where they sing, light the Chalice and have moments of Intergenerational worship. The children are then .sung out. and walk through a bridge of loving hearts to their classrooms.

The children are then “sung out” and walk through a bridge of loving hearts to their classrooms.
<p>Classrooms are determined by age and development. Each class has a group of spiritual nurturers (teachers) who lead the curriculum. In class children light the chalice, share their joys and concerns and are presented with a story and activity or a prompt and discussion for youth, in reference to the theme that is being presented in worship.

<p>The Religious Education Program is guided by professional staff. Spiritual nurturers are members of the congregation. It is expected that parents will volunteer in the program at least every other year. Child Space (for those under 3) is available during both services. Structured religious education for those aged three through 8th grade meets at the first service at 9:15 each Sunday. YRUU (High School) meets at 10:45 - noon, during the second service.
<p>Many special programs occur throughout the church year. They include but are not limited to: Child Dedications, Coming of Age, Bridging, Intergenerational Worship, social justice work and Our Whole Lives, sexuality curriculum.
<p>Enrollment forms are available from the Religious Education office.  Enrolling your child/youth helps us meet their needs; spiritually, socially and physically. If your child/youth has a severe allergy or needs another form of care, please let us know immediately.
<p>For more information regarding programs for children and youth at Conejo Valley Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, please contact: <a href='mailto:dre@cvuuf.org'>dre@cvuuf.org</a>.  We look forward to meeting you soon.
