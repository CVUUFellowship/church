<p class=MsoNormal>Anne was born in Pasadena and grew up in Altadena, attending public schools there and then entering Pasadena City College. Raised in the Episcopal faith, she found UUism while in college and joined Throop Church in Pasadena. She attended Immaculate Heart College, majoring in music. In 1977, Anne entered Starr King School for the Ministry and graduated with a Master of Divinity in the fall of 1982. She was ordained by the Mt. Diablo UU Church (Walnut Creek) in Nov. 1983. In April 1984, she began serving the UU Fellowship of San Dieguito (Solano Beach); she was their first minister after 25 years of lay leadership. She remained with them until the end of July, 1999. Subsequently Anne served as Interim Minister for the UU Fellowship of San Luis Obispo from August 1999 through July 2001; and as Interim Minister for the UU Church of South County (now Tapestry UU Church), in Mission Viejo from August 2001 through July 2002. In August 2002 Anne was called to Emerson Unitarian Universalist Church in Canoga Park and remained there until July 2014 -- the longest tenure of any minister in their 50 year history. Anne retired at the end of June and was voted by Emerson as Minister Emerita.
