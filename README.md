# Introduction

This repository is for the website maintenance team for the Chalice UU Fellowship.

The issues list here will be used to track issues both for the [member's site](https://members.cvuuf.org) and for the [public page](https://www.chaliceuu.org).

# Getting Started

If you're going to be helping with website maintenance, you'll need to:

 1. [create a github account](https://github.com â€º join), if you don't have one
 2. [open a new issue](https://github.com/CVUUFellowship/church/issues) requesting an invitation to the CVUUFellowship organization.
 3. [ask to join](https://groups.google.com/a/cvuuf.org/forum/#!forum/webcrafter) the webcrafter@chaliceuu.org group (if you're logged into a google account hopefully you have an "Apply to join" button there, else [check how to join](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/1067205?hl=en) and send an email to webcrafters if you can't find it).  
  Please include a link to the issue you created and your name, in case it's not obvious from your email.

Also, if you'll be logging into the hosting servers or checking in code, you'll need to [generate an SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and send your public key to webcrafter@chaliceuu.org (where someone will follow up with login instructions, and also add an account for you on the wordpress site).

# Process

We meet weekly online.  Assuming you've joined the webcrafter's group, you should get a link to a google hangouts emailed to you shortly before the meeting begins.

The meeting should last for about 30-45 minutes, and we'll try to go thru the list of open unassigned issues and assign those we can to a volunteer, then walk through any open issues people needed any help with.
